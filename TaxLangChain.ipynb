In the United States, the term \"taxes\" generally refers to the federal income tax, which is a tax on income earned by individuals and businesses. The process of filing taxes involves preparing and submitting a tax return to the relevant tax authority, such as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for federal taxes or a state or local tax authority for state or local taxes.\n",

            "2. Choose a filing status: Your filing status will depend on your marital status and family situation. The most common filing statuses are single, married filing jointly, married filing separately, head of household, and qualifying widow(er) with dependent child.\n",
            "3. Determine your income: Add up all of your income from various sources, including wages, salaries, tips, self-employment income, interest, dividends, and capital gains.\n",
            "4. Calculate your deductions: You may be eligible for deductions for things like charitable donations, medical expenses, mortgage interest, property taxes, and student loan interest.\n",
            "5. Figure out your tax liability: Use a tax table or tax software to calculate how much you owe in taxes based on your income, deductions, and any credits you're eligible for.\n",
            "6. Complete and submit your tax return: Once you have all of the necessary information, you can complete your tax return using tax software or by hand. Be sure to sign and date your return, and mail it to the appropriate address by the deadline.\n",
            "7. Check your refund: If you're due a refund, you can check the status of your refund online or through tax software.\n",

Generally, an employee who is otherwise eligible (for example, a salaried employee in a salaried only plan) must be eligible to \\nparticipate in the plan at age 21, or upon completion of 1 year of service, whichever is later.

General Rule-Once an employee, otherwise eligible, meets the statutory age and service requirements, the plan must cover him \\nor her on either the first day of the plan year after the employee has met the statutory requirements, or 6 months after the day on which \\nthe employee fulfills such requirements, which ever is earlier. There is an exception to this rule if an employee was separated from service \\nand did not return before the applicable entry date referred to above. If the separated employee returns, after either date, without incurring \\na break in service, the employer must cover the employee upon return. When a plan???s service requirements are more generous than \\nthe statute allows, the plan will qualify if the total waiting period is not longer than the statutory minimums. For example, in a plan with \\nno age or service requirement, a new employee, otherwise eligible,may be excluded until the next annual anniversary date of the plan \\nafter employment. This provision will not disqualify the plan because no employee can be required to wait longer than a 12-month period \\nunder the terms of the plan. Rules concerning a rehired employee who has a break in service are in II. j. and k. and III.g. and h. of these \\nexplanations.\\nSpecial rules apply where the plan uses the elapsed time method of crediting service. These are: a plan using the elapsed time method \\nmust provide that an employee, once eligible, who satisfies the statutory age and service requirement must be covered on the first day \\nof the plan year after the employee has met the statutory requirements, or 6 months after the day on which the employee fulfills such \\nrequirements, whichever is earlier, unless the employee was separated from service before the applicable entry date. Apply different \\nrules if the separated employee returns after the applicable entry date, whether or not the employee had a period of severance. A period \\nof severance begins on the date of severance from service. A ???severance from service??? occurs either when an employee quits, retires, is \\ndischarged, or dies; or on the first anniversary of the first day of a period of absence from service for any other reason (such as vacation, \\nholiday, disability, or layoff), whichever date comes first. Thus, if an employee separates, for any reason other than quitting, retiring, or \\ndischarge and returns within 12 months, there is no period of severance. In that case, if the employee returns after either entry date, the \\nemployer must cover the employee no later than the date the absence ended, effective the first applicable entry date that occurred during \\nthe absence from service. In the case of a period of severance, if the separated employee returns after a period of severance of less than 1 \\nyear and that period includes an entry date applicable to the employee, then the employer must cover the employee no later than the date \\non which the employee ended the period of severance. Rules for a rehired employee who has incurred a 1-year period of severance are in \\nIII. g. and h. of these explanations. The above rule is illustrated in the following examples.\\nExample 1.\\nA plan provides for a minimum age requirement of 21 and a minimum service requirement of 1 year with semi-annual entry dates. \\nEmployee X, after satisfying the minimum age requirement, became disabled for 9 consecutive months and then returned to service. \\nSince X separated from service because of a disability, there is no severance from service until the first anniversary of the date the \\nseparation occurred. X therefore did not have a period of severance under the elapsed time rules. During the period of absence, \\nX completed a 1-year period of service and passed a semi-annual entry date after satisfying the minimum service requirement. \\nAccordingly, the plan must make X a participant no later than the return to service, effective as of the applicable entry date.\\nExample 2.\\nEmployee B, after satisfying the minimum age and service requirements, quit work (date the period of severance begins) before the \\nnext semi-annual entry date, and then returned to service before incurring a 1-year period of severance but after the semi-annual entry \\ndate. Employee B is entitled to become a participant immediately upon the return to service, effective as of the date of the return.\\n410(a) (4)\\n1.410(a)-4(b)\\n1.410(a)-7(c) (3)For applications submitted to conform to the 2020 RA ListPage 3\\nLine d. For plan years beginning before January 1, 1988, a defined benefit plan or a target benefit plan may exclude an employee because \\nof maximum age, provided the maximum age specified is not more than 5 years before a plan???s normal retirement age. An employee may \\nbe denied entrance into a plan because of maximum age only if he or she commences employment within 5 years of the plan???s normal \\nretirement age. The maximum age conditions have been repealed effective for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1988, with \\nrespect to employees credited with an hour of service on or after that date. Accordingly, any employee, regardless of age, who has at least \\none hour of service after December 31, 1987, and who satisfies the otherwise applicable conditions for participation, may not be excluded \\nfrom participation on account of age beginning with the first day of the first plan year commencing in 1988. For purposes of determining \\nwhether such an employee has met the conditions for participation, all service otherwise required to be credited, including service in pre-\\n1988 plan years, must be credited regardless of whether the plan contained a maximum age exclusion prior to the first plan year beginning \\nin 1988.\\n410(a)(2) as amended by section 9203(a)(2) of Pub. L.\\n99-509 and Proposed Regs. 1.410(a)-4A.\\nII. Years of Service\\nIf the plan has no service requirement, DO NOT complete this section. \\nLine a. An eligibility computation period is a 12-consecutive-month period used to determine whether an employee has completed a year \\nof service for participation purposes. Any plan must designate an eligibility computation period, except a plan that uses an ???elapsed time??? \\nmethod of counting service or a plan that has no service requirement for eligibility to participate. If the plan uses the ???elapsed time??? method \\nof counting service, check N/A and skip to section III.\\nDOL Regs. 2530.200b-1(a)\\nLine b. Depending on the definition of ???hours of service??? and the method used to count these hours, a plan must credit an employee with \\n1 year of service for eligibility if the employee completes at least 1000, 870, or 750 hours of service in an eligibility computation period.\\ni) (H = 1000) A plan that counts all hours of service, or that uses an equivalency based on a period of employment (day, week, semi-\\nmonthly payroll period, month, or shift), cannot require the completion of more than 1000 hours of service. \\n410(a) (3) (A)\\nDOL Regs. 2530.200b-1(a)\\nDOL Regs. 2530.200b-3(e)\\nii) (H = 870) A plan that counts ???hours worked,??? or that uses an equivalency based on earnings for an employee who is compensated \\non an hourly rate, cannot require the completion of more than 870 hours of service.\\nDOL Regs. 2530.200b-3(d) (1)\\nDOL Regs. 2530.200b-3(f) (1)\\niii) (H = 750) A plan that counts ???regular time hours,??? or that uses an equivalency based on earnings for an employee who is \\ncompensated on a basis other than an hourly rate, cannot require the completion of more than 750 hours of service.\\nDOL Regs. 2530.200b-3(d) (2)\\nDOL Regs. 2530.200b-3(f) (2)\\nAnswer the following by using the applicable method of counting hours (i, ii, or iii above).\\nLine c.  If a plan counts all hours of service, credit each hour for which (1) an employee is paid or entitled to payment for performance of \\nduties, (2) an employee is paid or entitled to payment because of a period of time during which no duties are performed, and (3) back pay \\nis either awarded or agreed to by the employer.\\nDOL Regs. 2530.200b-2(a)\\nIf a plan credits hours of service by an equivalency based on a period of service, and an employee is required to be credited with at least 1 \\nhour of service under the paragraph above, then, depending on the basis used, the plan must credit hours of service as follows:\\nBasis of Equivalency: Number of Hours Credited:\\nDay........................................................................at least 10\\nWeek.....................................................................at least 45\\nBi-weekly payroll period........................................at least 95\\nMonth....................................................................at least 19\\nIf a plan counts ???hours worked,??? credit each hour for which an employee is paid or entitled to payment for the performance of duties; also \\ncredit hours for which back pay is awarded, or agreed to, by the employer to the extent that the back pay covers a period in which the \\nemployee would have been employed in the performance of duties for the employer.\\nDOL Regs. 2530.200b-3(d) (3) (i)\\nIf a plan counts ???regular time hours,??? credit each hour for which an employee is paid or entitled to payment for the performance of duties \\n(except hours for which a premium rate is paid).\\nDOL Regs. 2530.200b-3(d) (3) (ii)For applications submitted to conform to the 2020 RA ListPage 4\\nIf a plan credits hours of service by an equivalency based on earnings for an employee who is compensated on an hourly rate, an employee \\nmust be credited during a computation period with at least the number of hours equal to either the employee???s total earnings-\\n1) from time to time during the computation period, divided by the hourly rate of those times; or\\n2) for performance of duties during the computation period divided either by the employee???s lowest hourly rate during that time, or by \\nthe lowest hourly rate payable to an employee in the same, or a similar, job classification.\\nDOL Regs. 2530.200b-3(f) (1) (i)\\nIf a plan credits hours of service by an equivalency based on earnings, and determines compensation other than on an hourly rate, an \\nemployee must be credited during a computation period with at least the number of hours equal to his or her total earnings for duties \\nperformed during that period, divided by the employee???s lowest hourly rate of compensation during the same period. (See the DOL \\nRegulations.) Note: If the same hourly rate of compensation is used for all employees, this method may result in discrimination in favor of \\nhighly compensated employees.\\nDOL Regs. 2530.200b-3(f) 2\\nLine d. If H =1000 in b, above, answer this question; otherwise check N/A. If a plan credits hours of service of periods during which no \\nduties are performed, the plan must designate the method of determining the number of hours to be credited and the method of crediting the \\nhours to the computation periods. The plan must conform to the requirements of DOL Regulations sections 2530.200b-2(b) and (c). Section \\n2530.200-2(f) of the DOL Regulations, however, also indicates that a plan is not required to state these rules if they are incorporated by \\nreference.\\nDOL Regs. 2530.200b-2(b) and (c)\\nDOL Regs. 2530.200b-2(f)\\nLine e.  In general, the plan must initially use an eligibility computation period of 12-consecutive-months, beginning with the employee???s \\nemployment commencement date. This date is the first day for which the employee is entitled to be credited with an hour of service for the \\nperformance of duties.\\nAn alternative eligibility computation period, which may be used when employment commencement dates cannot be specifically determined, \\nis specified in DOL Regulations section 2530.202- 2(e). If this alternative is properly used, check Yes to this question.\\nDOL Regs. 2530.202-2(a)&(e).\\nLine f. If eligibility computation periods under a plan are determined solely on the anniversary of employment, check N/A.\\nIn general, an eligibility computation period is used to determine whether an employee has fulfilled service requirements for admission \\ninto the plan. It can also have a continuing use in determining whether an employee or participant with no vested interest in employer-\\nderived accrued benefits remains eligible to be a plan participant under the rule of parity (see j. and k. of these explanations). To determine \\nyears of service for either initial eligibility or retention of eligibility to participate in the plan and consequent nonforfeiture of accrued benefits, \\nplans may choose one of two eligibility computation periods after the initial computation period. First, the plan may continue to measure \\nyears of service, beginning on the employment commencement date and its anniversaries, or plans may shift to the plan year. However, the \\nfirst plan year must include the last day of the initial eligibility computation period. This overlapping is essential to assure that the employee \\ndoes not lose creditable service as a result of a gap between computation periods. A shift in the eligibility computation period must be made \\nwith respect to all employees. The application of the above rules is given in the following example:\\n Assume these circumstances:\\n   12/31/81\\n   termination\\n   of service\\n 1/1/81\\n 1000 hours\\n 12/1/80 11/30/81 \\n (date of hire)\\nThe chart shows an employee is hired on December 1, 1980, and the plan year is a calendar year. The employee terminates service \\non December 31, 1981, and has a 1-year break in service (December 31,1982). The employee has no vested right in any employer \\ncontributions. The employee worked 1000 hours between January 1, 1981, and November 30, 1981, and attained 1 year of service within \\nthe 12-month period following the date of hire. Figuring the pre-break service under DOL Regulations section 2530.202-2(c), the employee \\nwould receive credit for 1 year of service from December 1, 1980 (the date of hire) to November 30, 1981, and credit for another year of \\nservice for the plan year (calendar 1981) which includes the last day of the initial eligibility computation period. Thus, the employee receives \\ncredit for 2 years of service.\\nDOL Regs. 2530.202-2(b)\\n410(a) (3) (A)\\nIf the plan uses the alternative eligibility computation period described in DOL Regulations section 2530.202-2(e), special rules apply for the \\neligibility periods following the initial computation period. If this alternative is properly used, check Yes to this question.\\nDOL Regs. 2530.202-2(e) (2)For applications submitted to conform to the 2020 RA ListPage 5\\nLine g.  The break in service rules allow a plan to disregard certain service before the employee has a break. If all of an employee???s service \\nwith an employer is counted for participation, the plan need not provide these rules. In this case DO NOT complete questions g. through \\nk. of the worksheet.\\nDepending on the definition of ???hour of service??? and the method used to count these hours, a plan may charge an employee with a break in \\nservice for eligibility computation period In which the employee fails to complete more than B hours of service. The number required for B, \\nif a certain method of counting hours is used, equals half the hours used in question b. of this section of the worksheet. Therefore, a plan \\nmay provide that an employee be charged with a break in service if in a computation period the employee fails to complete: more than 500 \\nhours of service in a plan that counts all hours of service; or, more than 435 hours of the basis used is ???hours worked???; or, more than 375 \\nif the basis is ???regular time hours.???\\nDOL Regs. 2530.200b-3\\nDOL Regs. 2530.200b-4\\nLine h. To apply the break in service rules, the plan must use the same computation periods to measure breaks in service that it uses to \\nmeasure prior service for eligibility to participate. When a plan defines a year of service as 1000 (870 or 750) hours and an employee has \\nhours of service of more than 500 (435 or 375) but less than 1000 (870 or 750) hours, there is no break in service even though the plan will \\nnot credit the employee with a year of service.\\nDOL Regs. 2530.200b-4(a) (2)\\nLine i.  An individual shall be credited with certain hours of service if such individual is absent from work for any period by reason of 1) \\npregnancy of the individual, 2) birth of a child of the individual, 3) placement of a child with the individual in connection with an adoption \\nor 4) caring for a child described in (2) or (3) immediately following such birth or placement. This credit is credit for maternity or paternity \\nleave. Credit for maternity or paternity leave is only made to avoid a break in service and not to obtain a year of service. The absence does \\nnot have to be approved leave.\\nCredit for maternity or paternity leave is required only if such leave is on account of the reasons described above. Thus if an individual quits \\nemployment with employer A and two years later adopts a child, no credit under this provision would be given if the individual eventually \\nreturns to work for employer A because said individual???s absence from employer A???s workplace is on account of quitting and not on account \\nof the adoption of or the caring for the child immediately following the adoption.\\nHours of service must be credited to the computation period in which the first hour of maternity or paternity leave occurs, if such individual \\nwould experience a break in service with respect to such computation period if such maternity or paternity leave is not credited and \\nsuch individual will not experience a break in service if such maternity or paternity leave is credited. If such maternity or paternity leave is \\nnot credited to the first computation period, it is credited to the second computation period whether or not it is needed to preclude a break \\nin service.  \\nThe rules may be illustrated with the following example: Individual A separates from service on March 1, 1986, of a calendar year computation \\nperiod after earning 300 hours of service. The plan defines a year of service as a computation period in which the employee earns 1000 \\nhours. The employer provides for paid maternity leave for a period not to exceed 300 hours.\\nUnder the normal rules of crediting service paid maternity leave must be credited for service. Therefore, individual A in 1986 would not \\nexperience a break in service even if the hours required to be credited under REA are not so credited. Accordingly, no hours of service \\nwould be credited to the first computation period in 1986. Therefore, all such hours of service are credited in the second computation period \\nof 1987.\\nThe number of hours credited with respect to a computation period is the number of hours such individual would normally have worked in \\nthe computation period if such individual were not on maternity or paternity leave. If the number is not ascertainable, the plan may credit \\n8 hours with respect to any date said individual is absent on maternity or paternity leave. The plan may limit the number of hours credited \\nto any computation period to the number of hours needed to avoid a break in service, i.e., 501 hours, 436 hours, or 376 hours depending \\non how hours are counted. The plan may provide that the participant has the burden of proving that the absence was by reason of one of \\nthe covered causes.\\nThe plan can use a simplified method for complying with the requirements relating to maternity and paternity absences. If the plan???s break in \\nservice rules require a minimum of six consecutive one year breaks in service for service to be disregarded (versus the statutory minimum \\nof five), then the plan will not have to include any special rules relating to maternity and paternity absence. This simplified method is \\navailable only if the plan computes years of service on the basis of hours of service or permitted equivalencies. It does not apply to elapsed \\ntime plans.\\n410(a)(5)(E)\\n1.401(a)-9\\nLines j. and k.  In general, an employee???s pre-break service does not have to be credited until the employee has completed 1 year of \\nservice after the break. This should not be confused with the following rule of parity. If a participant with no vested interest has a break in \\nservice under the rule of parity, service before the break need not be counted for participation if the number of consecutive 1-year breaks \\nequals or is more than the greater of 5 or the aggregate years of service completed before the break. The aggregate years of service \\ncompleted before the break does not include years of service that need not be counted because of earlier breaks. In the case of a plan For applications submitted to conform to the 2020 RA ListPage 6\\ndescribed in section 410(a) (1) (B) (i), that is, a plan that provides for 100 percent vesting after 2 years of service, an employee who has \\nnot met the plan???s service requirement and has a one year break in service need not have pre-break service taken into consideration for \\npurposes of meeting the plan???s service requirement.\\nWhen an employee???s pre-break service must be taken into account after a year of service, an employee who meets the plan???s eligibility \\nrequirements and has a break need to be credited with the pre-break service until completion of a year of service after returning. However, \\nat that time the employee would be required to retro-actively participate under the plan. The following examples illustrate this rule:\\nExample 1.\\nA calendar year plan provides that an employee may enter the plan on the first semi-annual entry date, January 1, or July 1, after \\nsatisfying the minimum age and service requirements. Employee C, after working 10 years, separated from service in 1976 with \\na vested benefit. On February 1, 1990, C returns to employment covered by the plan. C then completes a year of service. C must \\nparticipate either immediately on returning or, after the year of service, retroactively to February 1, 1990. The prior service cannot be \\ndisregarded because of the vested benefit C had upon separation; therefore, the plan may not postpone participation until July 1,1990.\\nExample 2.\\nA defined contribution plan has a 1-year service requirement for participation and no age requirement. Contributions and allocations \\nare made for eligible employees on December 31. An employee is hired on January 1, 1985, and works 1000 hours in 1985 and 600 \\nhours in 1986. On June 30, 1986, the employee separates from service without a vested interest. The employee then has a break in \\nservice for the years 1987, 1988, and 1989. The employee returns on July 1, 1990. In accordance with the break in service rules, the \\nplan provides that the employee must complete 1 year of service after returning before the pre-break service is credited (year 1985). \\nTherefore, no contribution need be made on the employee???s behalf on December 31, 1990, because the employee is not eligible \\nto participate at that time. On June 30, 1991, the employee completes 1 year of service and is credited with the pre-break service. \\nBecause the number of consecutive breaks in service is less than 5, the pre-break service may not be ignored; thus the employee must \\nparticipate retroactively from July 1, 1990. If the employee is not covered on December 31, 1990, the waiting period is longer than the \\nmaximum allowed, taking into account the pre-break service.\\n410(a)(5)(C) & (D)\\n1.410(a)-4\\nIII. Years of Service and Breaks in Service Based on Elapsed Time\\nIf the plan has no service requirement or does not use an elapsed time method of crediting years of service for eligibility, DO NOT complete \\nthis section.\\nUnlike the general method of crediting service for an employee, which is based on hours and years of service, the elapsed time alternative \\ngenerally credits an employee with the total time that elapses during his or her employment. This alternative lessens the administrative \\nburdens of maintaining records of hours of service. It enables the employer to credit service from date of employment to date of severance \\nwithout counting hours of service completed during that time.\\nLine a.  The employment commencement date must be no later than the date on which the employee first performs an hour of service \\nfor the employer. The severance from service date is the earlier of the date an employee quits, retires, is discharged, or dies, or the \\nfirst anniversary of the first day of a period of absence from service for any reason other than quitting, retiring, discharge, or death. The \\nemployee must be credited with a period of service equal to at least the time between the employment commencement date and the \\nseverance from service date.\\n1.410(a)-7(b)\\nLine b.  Generally, a plan must aggregate all separate periods of service, except any that may be disregarded because of the rule of \\nparity. (See III. h.) Alternatively, instead of keeping separate periods of service, the plan may aggregate by adjusting the employment \\ncommencement date. If the plan used the alternative to credit the aggregate period of service, check Yes for question b.\\n1.410(a)-7(b) (6) (ii)\\n1.410(a)-7(b) (2) (iv)\\nLine c.  A period of severance is the time between the employee???s severance from service date and the date the employee again performs \\nan hour of service for the same employer.\\nIf an employee severs from service by quitting, being discharged, or retiring, and then performs an hour of service within 12 months of the \\nseverance from service date, the plan must consider the period of severance as a period of service.\\nAlso, if an employee severs from service for any reason other than quitting, being discharged, or retiring, and within the next 12 months or \\nless quits, is discharged, or retires and then performs an hour of service within 12 months of the date on which he or she was first absent \\nfrom service, the plan must consider that period of severance as a period of service.\\n1.410(a)-7(c) (2) (iii)For applications submitted to conform to the 2020 RA ListPage 7\\nLine d.  When a plan has a service requirement and uses the elapsed time method of crediting service, an employee must be considered \\nto have satisfied that requirement as of the date he or she has credit for a period of service equal to the requirement. All periods of service, \\nexcept those disregarded due to the rule of parity, must be aggregated. Certain periods of severance must be considered as periods of \\nservice (see question c) when determining this eligibility date.\\nSection I deals with the date an employee must begin participation in these situations.\\n1.410(a)-7(c) (2)\\nLine e. The break in service rules allow a plan to disregard certain service before the employee has a break. If all of an employee???s \\nservice with an employer is counted for participation, the break in service rules need not be provided by the plan. In this case, check \\nN/A for questions e. through h. of the worksheet. If a plan uses elapsed time substitute ???1-year period of severance??? for ???1-year break in \\nservice.??? A 1-year period of severance is a 12-consecutive-month period beginning on the severance from service date and ending on the \\nfirst anniversary of that date provided that within this period the employee does not perform an hour of service for the employer maintaining \\nthe plan.\\n1.410(a)-7(c) (4)\\nLine f. An individual shall not incur the first 12-month period of severance that would otherwise be counted if severance is due to maternity \\nor paternity leave. Such 12-month period is neither counted as a year of service nor as a period of severance. Maternity or paternity leave \\nis a period an individual is absent from work by reason of 1) pregnancy of the individual, 2) birth of the child of the individual, 3) placement \\nof a child with the individual for adoption or 4) caring for a child described in (2) or (3).\\nCredit for maternity or paternity leave is required only if such leave is on account of the reasons described above. Thus, if an individual quits \\nemployment with employer A and two years later adopts a child, no credit under this provision could be given if the individual eventually \\nreturns to work for employer A because such individual???s absence from employer A???s workplace is on account of quitting and not on account \\nof the adoption of or the caring for the child immediately following the adoption.\\nIf an individual works until July 1, 1986, is first absent from employment on July 1, 1986 on account of maternity or paternity leave, and on \\nJuly 1, 1989 performs an hour of service, the period of service must include the period from the employment commencement date until \\nJune 30, 1987 (one year after the date of separation for a reason other than an employee quitting, retirement, discharge or death). The \\nperiod from July 1, 1987 to June 30, 1988 is neither a period of service nor a period of severance. The period of severance would be from \\nJuly 1, 1988 to June 30,1989.\\n410(a)(5)(E)\\n1.410(a)-9\\nLines g. and h. In general, an employee???s service before a 1-year period of severance is not required to be credited until the employee \\ncompletes a 1-year period of service after the period of severance. The rule of parity applies to employees who are not vested. If a participant \\nwith no vested interest has a 5-year or more period of severance, service before the severance need not be counted for participation if the \\nperiod of severance equals or is more than the aggregate periods of service before the break. The period of service completed before the \\nperiod of severance does not include service that need not be counted because of earlier periods of severance.  \\nWhen service before a 5-year or more period of severance must be taken into account after a 1-year period of service, an employee who \\nmeets the plan???s eligibility requirements and has a 1-year period of severance need not be credited with pre-break service until he or \\nshe completes a 1-year period of service after severance. However, at that time the employee would be required to participate under the \\nplan retroactively. The following examples illustrate this rule:  \\nExample 1.\\nA calendar year plan provides that an employee may enter the plan only on the first semi-annual entry date, January 1, or July 1, \\nafter satisfying minimum age and service requirements. Employee C, after 10 years of service, separated from service in 1976 with a \\nvested benefit. On February 1, 1990, C returns to employment covered by the plan and completes a 1-year period of service. C must \\nparticipate either immediately on returning or, after a 1-year period of service, retroactively to February 1, 1990. C???s prior service cannot \\nbe disregarded because of the vested benefit C had when separating from service. Therefore, the plan may not postpone participation \\nuntil July 1, 1990.\\nExample 2.\\nA defined contribution plan has a 1 year service requirement for participation, and no age requirement. Contributions and allocations \\nare made for eligible employees on December 31. An employee is hired on January 1, 1985, and separates from service without a \\nvested interest on June 30, 1987. The employee returns on July 1, 1990, after a 3-year period of severance. Under the break in service \\nrules, the plan provides that the employee must complete a 1-year period of service after returning before the 2??-year period of pre-\\nbreak service is credited. Therefore, no contribution need be made on the employee???s behalf on December 31, 1990, because the \\nemployee is not eligible to participate at that time. On June30, 1991, the employee completes a 1-year period of service and is credited \\nwith the pre-break service and must participate retroactively from July 1, 1990 because the period of severance is less than 5 years. If \\nthis employee is not covered on December 31, 1990, the waiting period is longer than the maximum allowed, taking into account the \\npre-break period of service.For applications submitted to conform to the 2020 RA List\\nForm5622 (Rev. 6-2021) Catalog Number 42697Z publish.no.irs.gov Department of the Treasury - Internal Revenue ServiceEmployee Benefit Plan\\nMinimum Participation Standards \\n(Worksheet Number 1 ???

Overview   \\n(1) Section 501(a) provides for the tax exemption of certain organizations , including \\nthose described in Section 501(c) . Many categories of organizations are listed \\nunder Section 501(c) . Each category has different requirements that must be met \\nfor an organization to be described under that category.  \\n(2) One of the most common types of tax-exempt  organizations , due to its ability to \\nreceive tax -deduc tible contributions  (as well as other benefits)  are those \\ndescribed in Section 501(c)(3) .  \\nA. Introduction to Section 501(c )(3)  \\n(1) Section 501(c)(3) organizations are often referred to collectively as ???charities??? or \\n???charitable organizations.??? However, permitted Section 501(c)(3) purposes include  religious, charitable, scientific, testing for public safety, literary, \\neducational, the fostering of national or international amateur sports \\ncompetition, or the prevention of cruelty to children or animals .  \\n(2) Specific requirements must be met to qualify for tax exemption under Section 501(c)(3). Failure to satisfy any of the requirements results in an organization not qualifying for exempt status when applying for recognition of exemption or  \\ncan result in the loss of such status once a violation is detected by the IRS.  \\n(3) These organizations  are eligible to receive tax -deductible contributions unlike \\nmost other exempt organizations. They also enjoy other benefits under the IRC, as well as under state or local income, property, sales, use, or other tax provisions.  \\n(4) Section  501(c)(3) organizations are classified as either public charit ies or \\nprivate foundations. In general, the basis for distinguishing between public \\ncharities and private foundations is the level of public support an organization receives over time. Also, c ertain organizations may qualify as public charities as \\na matter of law. Compar ed to public charities, p rivate foundations are subject to \\nmore restrictions on their activities  and are subject to certain excise taxes . \\nAdditionally,  charitable contribution deductibility is less favorable for private \\nfoundations . \\n(5) This technical guide discusses Section 501(c)(3) organizations providing an \\noverview  of: \\na. Exemption requirements  \\nb. Other considerations  (for example, foundation status, employment tax \\nrequirements and so forth.)  \\nc. Application requirements for exemption  \\nd. Return filing requirements  \\ne. Examination techniques   \\nf. Other resources  -8-   B. Backgro und / History   \\n(1) The 16th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was ratified on February 3, 1913,  \\nallowing for the levying of income tax . Congress then enacted the Revenue Act \\nof 1913, Ch. 16, 38 Stat. 114, on October 3, 1913 (also known as the \\nUnderwood Tariff Act ). This act established ???charitable??? as a purpose that is \\nexempt from federal income tax.  \\n(2) In 1939 the Internal Revenue Code was codified, and organizations pursuing \\ncharitable activities were exempt from taxation under Section 101(6). The recodification of the C ode in 1954, as the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, \\nredesigned and reordered the code to designate organizations exempt from federal i ncome tax under Section 501(c)(3) where ???charitable??? remained an \\nexempt purpose.  \\n(3) The Tax Reform Act of 1969 expanded Section 501(c)(3) law by providing:  \\na. Organizations created after October 9, 1969,  won???t  be treated as an \\norganization described in Section 501(c)(3) unless they apply for exemption. Exceptions apply  See Section  508.  \\nb. Organizations described in Section 501(c)(3) are presumed to be private foundations unless they meet one of the ex ceptions list ed in Section \\n509(a).  \\nc. Special private foundation rules.  \\n(4) Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 provides for the exemption of organizations organized and operated exclusively for ???charitable??? purposes.  \\nC. Citation of Law and Non -Precedential Guidance \\n(1) Throughout this Guide, citations of law are provided as guidance on the government???s position on specific activities and actions of the exempt organization.  \\n(2) While the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) is the primary source of Federal tax law, there are many additional sources. For example, there are both administrative and judicial interpretations as well. Administrative materials include Treasury Regulations, Revenue Rulings, and Revenue Procedures. Federal Courts that interpret Federal tax law include trial courts, appellate  \\ncourts, and ultimately the Supreme Court.  \\n(3) Committee reports issued by Congressional committees during the legislative process are useful tools in determining Congressional intent behind certain tax laws and help examiners apply the law properly , particularly with respect to \\nnovel issues where the literal language of the IRC is ambiguous, where there is \\nlittle to no judicial history, and/or when the Treasury has not drafted regulations.  \\n(Note:  Agents encountering novel i ssues in a case where there is little to  no \\nlaw on point should contact Counsel for assistance with the case. ) -9-   C.1. Precedential Citation of Law \\n(1) When citing case law, follow Internal Revenue Manual (IRM) 4.75.13.10 and \\n4.10.7.2 for the proper citation of law . The following is the order of precedential \\nauthori ties the IRS follows when reviewing cases.   \\n(2) Internal Revenue Code (Title 26 of the United States Code) is the foundation \\nfor all tax law. When changes are made to the IRC, the old language is deleted, and new language is inserted. Originally codified in 1939 as the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, it was recodified in 195 4 and 1986. It is now \\nreferred to as the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The IRC is divided into subtitles, chapters, subchapters, parts, subparts, sections, subsections, paragraphs, subparagraphs and clauses.  \\n(3) Treasury Regulations assist in interpreting the IRC. The regulations often \\ncontain examples and computations that assist in understanding the statutory language. The regulations are issued as proposed, temporary and final. References made to specific regulations throughout this TG are notated as Treas.  Reg.  \\n(4) Revenue Rulings provide guidance on the government???s position on specific \\nactivities and actions of an exempt organization. References made to specific \\nrevenue rulings throughout this TG are notated as Rev. Rul.  The purpose of \\nrevenue rulings and rev enue procedures is to promote uniform application of \\nthe tax laws. IRS employees must follow revenue rulings and revenue procedures. Taxpayers may rely on them or appeal their position to the Tax Court or other federal court.  \\n(5) Revenue Procedures are IRS pronouncements that deal with procedural \\naspects of the law. Specific reference to revenue procedures throughout this \\nTG are notated as Rev. Proc.  \\n(6) Rulings and procedures are published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin  \\n(I.R.B.) available on www.irs.gov. Note:  Rulings and procedures were \\npreviously published weekly  in a paper version of the I.R.B. and semiannually \\nin the Cumulative Bulletin (C.B.) . On March 11, 2013, the IRS announced it \\nwould stop printing the paper I.R.B. and eliminated the C.B. after the 2008- 2 \\nedition. See Ann. 2013- 12. \\n(7) Judicial decisions comprise an important source of tax law. Judges are \\nreputed to be unbiased individuals who render decisions on questions of fact and/or law. Judges do not always agree. So often, a decision must be made against a background of conflicting judicial authorities.  \\na. Trial Courts \\nThere are three trial courts for tax adjudication in the United States: the \\nU.S. Tax Court, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims and the U.S. District \\nCourts.  -10-   b. Appellate Courts \\nDecisions can be appealed from the U.S. Tax Court and the U.S. District \\nCourts to the Court of Appeals in the taxpayer???s circuit. Appeals from the U.S. Court of Federal Claims are taken to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. A party who loses at an appellate level may ask the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari to argue the case.  \\nc. US Supreme Court  \\nDecisions of the U.S. Courts of Appeal, including the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, may be appealed to the United States Supreme Court. The Supreme Court of the United States is the highest court of the land. In general, Supreme Court review is discretionary. The Supreme Court accepts cases which it views as having national importance. Only a limited number of tax cases are heard.  \\n(8) Committee Reports indicate legislative intent to a proposed bill. The Ways \\nand Means Committee in the House of Representatives and the Finance Committee in the Senate are responsible for tax legislation. In cases where the literal language of the IRC is ambiguous, Committee Reports are useful tools in determining Congressional intent behind certain tax laws and help examiners apply the law properly.  \\nC.2. Legal Guidance  \\n(1) Treatment of IRS Official Rulings and Procedures:  In St. David\\'s Health \\nCare System. v. United States, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals noted that ???the courts generally accord significant weight to the determinations of the IRS in its revenue rulings.??? 349 F.3d 232, 239 n.9 (5th Cir. 2003); see Estate of McLendon v. Commissioner, 135 F.3d 1017, 1023 n.10, 1024 (5th Cir.1998) \\n(stating ???revenue rulings are generally given weight as expressing the studied view of the agency whose duty it is to carry out the statute,??? but are ???clearly less binding on the courts than treasury regulations or Code provisions???).  \\n(2) An IRS Action on Decision (AOD) - is a formal memorandum prepared by \\nthe IRS Office of Chief Counsel that announces the future litigation position the IRS will take with regard to the court decision addressed by the AOD. The IRS???s AOD policy on feder al court decisions decided in the taxpayers??? favor is \\ndescribed in the Chief Counsel Directives Manual CCDM 36.3.1 (03- 14-2013), \\nor its successor.  The IRS has an acquiescence policy regarding federal court \\ndecisions decided in the taxpayers??? favor.  \\na. Acquies cence (acq.) occurs when the IRS accepts the decision and will \\nfollow the ruling in all jurisdictions.  \\nb. Non-acquiescence (nonacq.) occurs when IRS disagrees with the court \\ndecision. The IRS is required to follow the precedent in the circuit where the decision was made, but may otherwise hold its own position in all other circuits.  -11-   c. The IRS decision of acquiescence or non- acquiescence is published in the \\nCumulative Bulletin and IRS agents are bound by the determinations.  \\nC.3. Non-precedential Guidance  \\n(1) This Technical Guide and other guides will refer to non- precedential guidance \\nthroughout this discussion. This guidance may not be ci ted as precedent. It \\ndoes, however, provide the government???s position on issues and assists with \\ndeveloping a fact pattern as well as application of the law to the facts of a case for revenue agent reports. The non- precedential guidance presented in this \\nTechnical Guide is as follows:  \\na. Technical advice memorandum  (TAM) is guidance furnished by the \\nOffice of Chief Counsel upon the request of an IRS director or an area director, appeals, in response to technical or procedural questions that \\ndevelop during a pr oceeding. A request for a TAM generally stems from \\nan examination of a taxpayer\\'s return, a consideration of a taxpayer\\'s \\nclaim for a refund or credit, or any other matter involving a specific taxpayer under the jurisdiction of the territory manager or the area \\ndirector, appeals. A TAM is issued only on closed transactions and provide the interpretation of proper application of tax laws, tax treaties, regulations, revenue rulings or other precedents. The advice rendered represents a final determination of t he position of the IRS, but only with \\nrespect to the specific issue in the specific case in which the advice is issued. TAMs are generally made public after all information has been removed that could identify the taxpayer whose circumstances triggered a specific memorandum.  \\nb. Private letter ruling (PLR) is a written statement issued to a taxpayer that \\ninterprets and applies tax laws to the taxpayer\\'s specific set of facts. A PLR is issued to establish with certainty the federal tax consequences of a particul ar transaction before the transaction is consummated or before the \\ntaxpayer\\'s return is filed. A PLR is issued in response to a written request submitted by a taxpayer and is binding on the IRS if the taxpayer fully and accurately described the proposed tr ansaction in the request and carries \\nout the transaction as described. A PLR may not be relied on as precedent by other taxpayers or IRS personnel. PLRs are generally made public after all information has been removed that could identify the taxpayer to whom it was issued.  \\nc. General counsel memorandum  (GCM) is a formal legal opinion of the \\nchief counsel responding to inquiries from a National Office function outside of chief counsel or explaining the legal basis for the position taken in a TAM, letter ruling,  or revenue ruling. GCMs are generally made public \\nafter all information has been removed that could identify the taxpayer to whom it was issued.  \\nd. IRS publications explain the law in plain language for taxpayers and their \\nadvisors. They typically highlight changes in the law, provide examples illustrating Internal Revenue Service positions, and include worksheets. -12-   Publications are nonbinding on the Service and do not necessarily cover \\nall positions for a given issue. While a useful source of general informat ion, publications should not be cited to sustain a position. \\nPublications may be found on the published products catalog and may be searched by title, catalog number, product number, or key word search.  \\nD. Relevant Terms  \\n(1) Charity or Charitable Organization:  A term commonly used to refer to \\norganizations described in Section 501(c)(3).  \\n(2) Cy Pres: The term ???cy pres??? comes from French language and means ???so near??? \\nor ???as near as possible.??? The cy pres  doctrine provides that where the particular \\npurpose of a charitabl e trust has become impossible, impractical, or illegal to \\ncarry out and the trust settlor had a more general charitable intent, a court has the power to direct the trust property to a charitable purpose that falls within the general charitable intent of the settlor . See Restatement of Trusts (Second) \\n399. \\n(3) Determination Letter : A letter issue d by the IRS recognizing an organization???s \\nexempt status and providing its foundation classification i f an application for \\nexemption and all information received by t he IRS establishes than an \\norganization meets the requirements for exemption.  \\n(4) Dissolution: The method by which an organization exempt under Section \\n501(c)(3) ceases operations and distributes i ts net assets for one or more \\nexempt purposes. to a governmental entity or to another 501(c)(3) organization.   \\n(5) Inter -vivos Trust:  A trust created during the lifetime of a grantor which \\ntransfers legal title of trust property to a trustee to hold and to manage for a third party in accordance with the intent of the grantor.  \\n(6) Operation:  The act or process of operating or functioning.  \\n(7) Organization:  Bodies of persons formed f or a particular purpose.  \\n(8) Revocation:  The loss of tax -exempt status by an organization initiated by the \\nIRS. (Note: Automatic revocation, described in Section 6033(j) , happens by \\noperati on of law rather than actions initiated by the IRS.)  \\n(9) Tax-Exempt Organization:  An organization described in Section 501(c) or (d) \\nand exempt from taxation (under Title 26 of United States Code).  \\nE. Law / Authority  \\n(1) Section 170(b)(1)(A)  \\n(2) Section 501(a)  \\n(3) Section 501(c)(3)  \\n(4) Treas. Reg. 1.170A -2. \\n(5) Treas. Reg. 1.170A -4A. \\n(6) Treas. Reg. 1.501(a) -1 -13-   (7) Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1 \\nF. Exemption Requirements  \\n(1) Organizations must  meet all of the following requirements to qualify for \\nexemption under Section 501(c)(3) : \\na. Organized and operated exclusively for Section 501(c)(3) purposes   \\nb.  None of its  earnings may inure to any private shareholder or indi vidual  \\nc. No more than an incidental private benefit to private persons  \\nd. No substantial part of the organization???s activities may attempt to influence \\nlegislation (lobbying)  \\ne. May not participate or intervene in any political campaign for or against \\nany candidate for public office \\nf. Purposes and activities may not be illegal or violate fundamental public \\npolicy  \\ng. See Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1. \\nG. Organizational and Operational Test  Requirement s \\n(1) Section 501(c)(3) requires an organization to be both ???organized??? and ???operated??? exclusively for one or more Section 501(c)(3) purposes. If the organization fails either the organizational test or the operational test, it isn???t exempt. See Treas. Reg. 1. 501(c)(3) -1(a)(1). \\n(2) The following organizations (described elsewhere within Section 501) are treated as charitable organizations described within Section 501(c)(3) and generally are subject to their own organizational and operational requirements:  \\na. Cooperati ve hospital service organizations (Section 501(e))  \\nb. Cooperative service organizations of operating educational organizations (Section 501(f)).  \\nc. Childcare organizations (Section 501(k))  \\nd. Charitable risk pools (Section 501(n))  \\ne. Credit counseling organizations ( Section 501(q)), and  \\nf. Hospital organizations (Section 501(r)).  \\nNote:  See Technical Guide, TG 3- 6: IRC 501(c)(3) Exempt Purposes Testing \\nfor Public Safety, Literary, Fostering Amateur Sports, Prevention of Cruelty to \\nChildren or Animals, and Other 501(c)(3) Purposes; 501(f), 501(j), 501(k), 501(m), 501(n), 501(q) . (Note:   TG 3- 6 will be published in the future. For a list \\nof all TGs published and in process, see the cumulative list of Technical Guides located in TG 0 Technical Guides Overview , Exhib it III, starting on page 10. ) \\n  -14-    \\nH. Organizational Test  \\n(1) The organizational test applies to the organization???s articles of organiz ation,  \\nalso referred to  as the ???organizing document .??? An organization may be a \\ncorporation, trust, or unincorporated association. See section V. A. 8, Entity \\nTypes and Dates of Formation of this TG .  \\n(2) The articles of organiz ation are the written instrument by which an organization \\nis created. See Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(b)(2).  \\n(3) An organization is organized exclusively f or one or more exempt purposes only \\nif its articles of organization:  \\na. Limit the purposes to one or more exempt purposes (???purpose clause???) See Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(b)(1)(i)(a); and   \\nb. Don???t expressly empower the organization to engage in activities (other than as an insubstantial part of its activit ies) that don???t  further one or more \\nexempt purposes. See Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(b)(1)(i)(b).  \\nc. Dedicate an organization???s assets to an exempt purpose (dissolution \\nprovision) either by provision in its articles  of organization or by operation \\nof law.  See Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(b)(4).  \\n(4) Placing  the provisions in the bylaws isn??? t acceptable unless : \\na. The bylaws are the articles of organization for an unincorporated \\nassociation.  or \\nb. In the case of a corporation, the state law would give effect to such a provision. (Note:  This situation is not common and, in most instances,  \\ncorporations should have dissolution clause in the organizing document filed with its state of incorporation, often called Articles of Incorporation.  \\n(5) Private foundations have additional requirements for the articles of organization imposed by Section 508(e).  See section II.B. 7. Private Foundat ions. \\n(6) The articles of organization must meet the requirements in both form and \\nlanguage. Defects in the organizing documents can???t  be corrected by the \\norganization???s actual operations or by reference to other documents , including \\nForm 1023, Application for Recognition of Exemption Under Section 501(c)(3) \\nof the IRC , or other statements.   \\n(7) See Section V. A. 8., Entity Types and Dates of Formation,  of this TG  for \\ninformation on allowable entity types and characteristics .  \\nH.1. Exempt Purpose  \\n(1) An organization???s exempt purpose must be stated in its organizing \\ndocument  to meet the organizational test. See Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -\\n1(b)(1)(ii).  \\n(2) The term exempt purpose means any purpose specified in S ection 501(c)(3):  -15-   a. Charitable  \\nb. Religious  \\nc. Scientific  \\nd. Testing for Public Safety  \\ne. Literary  \\nf. Educational  \\ng. Fostering national or international sports competitions  \\nh. Prevention of cruelty to children or animals.  \\n(3) The stated purpose may be as broad as the purposes stated in Section \\n501(c)(3). For example, the purpose can be limited exclusively to one or more \\npurposes as stated in Section 501(c)(3)  as follows : \\n \\nSaid organization is organized exclusively for charitable, religious,  \\neducational, and scientific purposes, including, for such purposes, \\nthe making of distributions to organizations that qualify as exempt  \\norganizations under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, or  the corresponding section of any future Federal tax code.  \\n(4) The stated purpose may be more specific than the purposes stated in Section \\n501(c)(3).  The following example is acceptable as a specific purpose since \\nteaching sports to children (under age 18) is considered charitable (develops \\ncharacter , prevents juvenile delinquency ): \\n \\n???The or ganiz ation will teach lacrosse to youth ages 17 and under. ???  \\n(5) The organizing document must state a purpose that necessarily falls within \\nthe purposes stated in Section 501(c)(3). The following examples  don???t  meet  \\nthe organizational test as the purposes aren???t listed under Section 501(c)(3) and may or may not be conducted for charit able purposes:  \\n???The organization will provide housing to residents of Magnolia County.???  \\n???The organization will promote the health of residents of Magnolia County.???  \\n(6) The stated purpose may not be broader  than the purposes of Section \\n501(c)(3).  For example, the following purpose statement  is too broad because \\nbettering mankind  may be achieved in many ways, not all of which fall within \\nSection 501(c)(3) : \\n  \\n???The organization is organized to better mankind in all ways that \\nare allowed  and appropriate under the law. ??? \\n(7) Organizations that are organized for both exempt and nonexempt purposes \\nfail to meet the organizational test. The following rulings contain examples of -16-   organizing documents which included nonexempt purposes  causing the \\norganizations to fail to qualify under Section 501(c)(3) :  \\na. In Rev. Rul. 69- 279, 1969- 1 C.B. 152, an irrevocable inter vivos trust was \\ncreated to pay  a fixed percentage of all income earned annually to the \\nsettlor during his lifetime (which served private interests)  with the \\nremaining balance paid to charity after the settlor???s death.  \\nb. In Rev. Rul. 69 -256, 1969- 1 C.B. 151, a testamentary trust  was \\nestablished to make annual payments to exem pt charities and to use a \\nfixed sum from annual income for the care of the testator???s burial lot  \\n(which served private interests) .  \\n(8) If the organizing document contains a purpose that doesn???t  satisfy the  \\norganizational test, but such purpose is not expressl y contrary to Section \\n501(c)(3) exempt purposes, the addition of the following type of language to \\nthe organizing document  will let  the organization meet the purpose \\nrequirement of the organizational test:  \\n \\n???Notwithstanding other language (or provisions) in the creating \\ndocument, the purposes will be limited exclusively to exempt purposes within the meaning of IRC 501(c)(3).???  \\n For example, a n organizi ng document providing that an organization is formed \\nto promote philanthropic and eleemosynary purposes wouldn ???t satisfy  \\nthe purpose requirement. But  if the organizing document also states that  \\nnotwithstanding any other provision in this instrument, it w on???t further any  \\nspecified purpose to more than an insubstantial degree other than those  \\ndescribed in IRC 501(c)(3), the organization would satisfy the organizational \\ntest. \\nH.2. Express Powers  \\n(1) The organizational test won???t be met if  the organizing document  expressly \\nempowers the organization:  \\na. To carry on any other activities (unless they are insubstantial) which aren???t in furtherance of one or more exempt purposes. See Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(b)(1)(i)(b).  \\nb. To devote more than an insubstantial part of its acti vities to influence \\nlegislation by propaganda or otherwise. S ee Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -\\n1(b)(3)(i) . \\nc. To participate directly or indirectly in or  intervene in (including the \\npublishing or distributing of statements), any political campaign on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for public office. S ee Treas. Reg. \\n1.501(c)(3) -1(b)(3)(ii).  \\n(2) To have objectives and to engage in activities which c haracterize it as an \\n???action??? organization.  See Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(b)(3)(iii).  -17-   (3) Providing for a Section 501(h) election (where an organization elects to make \\nlobbying and grass roots expenditures that don???t normally exceed the ceiling \\namounts ) in an organization???s articles won???t violate the organizational test . See \\nTreas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(b)(3) (iii). \\nH.3.  Charitable Class Requirement  \\n(1) A charitable organization or trust must be set up for the benefit of an indefinite class of individuals . It may  not be set up for specific persons.  \\n(2) A trust or corporation organized and operated for the benefit of specific individuals isn???t charitable. For example:  \\na. A trust to benefit ??? John Jones ??? isn???t a charitable trust even though the facts \\nmay show that ??? John Jones ??? is impoverished . See Pasadena Methodist \\nFoundation  and Carrie A. Maxwell, Trust, Pasadena Methodist Foundation \\nv. Commissioner, 2 TCM 905 (1943).  \\nb. However, an organization set up with the general charitable purpose of benefitting needy individuals in a particular community is a charitable organization. It  may select ??? John Jones ??? as a beneficiary.  \\n(3) An organization may have a purpose to benefit a comparatively small class of beneficiaries provided the class is open and the identities of the individuals to be benefited remain indefinite. See the following rulings:  \\na. Rev. Rul. 56 -403, 1956- 2 C.B. 307, held that a foundation set up to award \\nscholarships solely to undergraduate members of a designated fraternity could be exempt as a charitable foundation  \\nb. Rev. Rul. 67- 367, 1967- 2 C.B. 188, held that an organization that made \\nscholarship payments to pre- selected, specifically named individuals didn???t \\nqualify for exemption.  \\nc. Rev. Rul. 57 -449, 1957- 2 C.B. 622, held that a trust to pay a certain sum \\nto all the individuals enrolled in a certain school on a particular date was a private trust, and not a charitable trust since the beneficiaries were a \\ngroup of identifiable individuals .  \\nH.4.  Dissolution Provision  \\n(1) An organization???s  assets must be dedicated to an exempt purpose to meet the \\norganizational test.  \\n(2) Assets wi ll be considered properly dedicated if the articles of organization \\nprovide for distribution of assets upon dissolution:  \\na. For one or more exempt purposes,  \\nb. To the feder al government or a state or local government, for a public \\npurpose, or  \\nc. To another organization (distributed by a court) to be used in a  manner \\nthat in the judgment of the court will best carry out  the general purposes \\nfor which the dissolved organization w as organized.  -18-   See Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(b)(4).  \\n(3) The following is an example of a dissolution provision that properly dedicates \\nan organization???s assets:  \\nUpon the dissolution of this organization, assets shall be distributed for one or more exempt purposes within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, or corresponding section of any future federal tax code, or shall be distributed to the federal government, or to a state or local government, for a public purpose.  \\n(4) The laws of some states provide for the distribution of charitable assets upon dissolution when organizing articles don???t have an express dissolution clause. See the following S ections, B.5. Operation of State Law  and B.6 Cy Pres \\nDoctrine  in this TG .  \\n(5) An organization???s ass ets aren???t properly dedicated if its organizing document \\nprovides that its assets  will b e distributed to its members or shareholders upon \\ndissolution. See Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(b)(4).  \\nH.5. Operation of State Law  \\n(1) Some state laws govern the distribution of assets upon dissolution when an \\norganizations??? governing documents don???t have an express dissolution provision. If assets are properly dedicated by operation of state law, the \\norganization???s governing documents do not need a dissolution cl ause.  \\nH.6.  The Cy Pres Doctrine  \\n(1) The term ???cy pres??? comes from the French language and means ???so near??? or \\n???as near as possible. ??? The cy pres doctrine is a legal doctrine that provides  \\nwhere the particular purpose of a charitable trust has become impossible, impractical, or illegal to carry out and the trust settlor had a more general charitable intent, a court has the power to direct the trust assets to a charitable purpose that falls within the general charitable intent of the settlor . \\n(2) Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(b)(4) provides that an organization is not considered \\norganized exclusively for one or more exempt purposes unless its assets are dedicated to an exempt purpose. An organization may satisfy this requirement \\nif, by reason of a provision in the organization???s articles or by operation of state law, its assets would be distributed upon dissolution for one or more exempt purposes, or to the Federal Government, or to a State or local government, for a public purpose, or would be distributed by a court to another organization to be used in such manner as in the judgment of the court will best accomplish the general purposes for which the dissolved organization was organized.  \\n(3) In Rev. Proc . 82-2, 1982- 1 C.B. 367, the IRS identified the states and \\ncircumstances in which the Service does not require an express dissolution provision in the articles of organization because state law satisfies the requirements of Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(b)(4).  Agents and taxpayers are \\ncautioned that the information in Rev. Proc. 82- 2 has not been updated and -19-   may have been affected by subsequent changes to state law. If it is not clear \\nthat current state law satisfies the requirements of Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -\\n1(b)(4), a dissolution provision should be included in the organizing document. (See example in Section H.4(3), of this TG, above.)  \\nH.7. Private Foundation s \\n(1) Section 508(e) (1) provides that the governing instrument of a private \\nfoundation must:  \\na. Require income di stributions for each tax year so as to not subject the \\nfoundation to taxes under Section  4942, and  \\nb. Prohibit the foundation from engaging in self -dealing under Section \\n4941(d), from retaining excess business holdings under Section  4943(c), \\nfrom investing f unds in a manner subjecting the foundation to tax under \\nSection  4944, and from making any taxable expenditures under Section  \\n4945(d).  \\n(2) The governing instrument will meet Section 508(e)(1) requirements if state law  \\nrequires the foundation to act or refrain from acting so as not to subject the foundation to the taxes imposed by Sections 4941- 4945 or  treats the \\ngoverning instrument as requiring this conduct. See Treas. Reg. 1.508- 3(d)(1).  \\n(3) In Rev. Rul. 75- 38, 1975- 1 C.B. 161, the IRS published a list of states that \\nhave adopted legislation satisfying the requirements of Section 508(e). Agents and taxpayers are cautioned that the information in Rev. Rul. 75- 38 has not \\nbeen updated and may have been affected by subsequent  changes to state \\nlaw. If it is not clear that current state law satisfies the requirements of Section 508(e), then the provisions described in Section 508(e) should be added to the private foundation???s governing instrument  \\n(4) Publication 557, Tax -Exempt Stat us for Your Organization, Chapter 3, Private \\nFoundations and Public Charities, provides sample language that will meet Section 508 requirements.  \\n(5) Special circumstances and exceptions exist. See Technical Guide, TG 3- 20: \\nIntroduction to Private Foundations and Special Rules Under IRC 508.   \\nH.8. Exempt Purposes  \\n(1) An organization will be regarded as operated exclusively for one or more exempt purposes only if it engages primarily in activities which accomplish one or more Section 501(c)(3) purposes.  An organization is n???t regarded as \\noperating exclusively for exempt purposes if more than an insubstantial part of its activities doesn???t  further exempt purposes. See Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -\\n1(c)(1).  \\n(2) An organization may be exempt as an organization described in Section \\n501(c )(3) if it???s organized and operated exclusively for one or more of the \\nfollowing exempt purposes:  \\na. Religious  -20-   b. Charitable  \\nc. Scientific  \\nd. Testing for public safety  \\ne. Literary  \\nf. Educational  \\ng. Foster national or international sports competition  \\nh. Prevention of cruelty to c hildren or animals.  \\nSee Section 501(c)(3) and Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(d)(1).  \\n(3) There???s no legal definition in the IRC  for commonly used  terms such as \\n???exclusively,??? ???primarily,??? ???substantial??? and ???insubstantial??? which are found \\nthroughout the IRC and regulations. For purposes of the operational test, these  terms a pply to the review  of the purposes, activities, time and resources \\nof exempt  organizations to determine if they are operating for Section \\n501(c)(3) purposes. There is no express formula or measurement in the IRC  \\nfor the operational test . Rather, a ll facts and circumstances  pertaining to the \\noperational test should be considered when making these determinations . \\n(4) Courts have provided general guidelines  on a case- by-case basis  that \\ninterpret the commonly used terms in Section 501(c)(3) . For example, s ee \\nBetter Business Bureau of Washington D.C., Inc. v. United States , 326 U.S. \\n279 (1945), in which the Supreme Court held that the presence of a single \\nnon-exempt purpose, if substantial in nature, will destroy the exemption \\nregardless of the number or importance of truly exempt purposes . \\nH.9. Charitable Defined  \\n(1) Treas.  Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(d)(2)  provides that the ter m \"charitable??? for \\npurposes of Section 501(c)(3) is used in its ???generally accepted legal sense.??? Charitable purposes include t he purposes listed above in Section C.1. and the \\nfollowing :  \\na. Relief of the poor, the distressed, or the underprivileged  \\nb. Advancement of religion \\nc. Advancement of education or science  \\nd. Erecting or maintaining public buildings, monuments, or works  \\ne. Lessening the burdens of government  \\nf. Promotion of s ocial welfare by organizations engaging in a. through e.  \\ng. Lessening neighborhood tensions  \\nh. Eliminating prejudice and discrimination  \\ni. Defending human and civil rights secured by law  \\nj. Combating community deterioration and juvenile delinquency  -21-   (2) See Technical  Guide, TG 3- 3: Exempt Purpose, Charitable IRC 501(c)(3) .  \\nH.10.  Religious or Advancement of Religion  \\n(1) The First Amendment to the United States Constitution provides  that \\n???Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or \\nprohibiting the free exercise thereof .???  Thus, First Amendment considerations \\nprevent Congress  and the Internal Revenue Service from establishing a \\ndefinition of the term ???religion.???  See GCM 36993 (1977) . \\n(2) However, the Supreme Court did interpret the term ???religious??? in United States \\nv. Seeger,  380 U.S. 163 (1965). The Court specifically interpreted the phrase \\n???religious training and belief??? as used in the Universal Military Training and Service Act, 50 U.S.C. Section 456(j), in determining an individual???s eligibility for exemption from military  service on religious grounds. The Court expressed \\nthe following definition: ???A sincere and meaningful belief which occupies in the \\nlife of its possessor a place parallel to that filled by the God of those admittedly \\nqualifying for the exemption comes within the statutory definition.???  \\n(3) See TG 3- 2, Exempt Purpose, Religious IRC 501(c)(3) for the requirements \\nthat must be met by an organization operating for religious purposes or the advancement of religion to qualify as charitable under Section 501(c)(3) . \\n(Note: TG 3 -2 will be published in the future. For a list of all TGs published \\nand in process, see the cumulative list of Technical Guides located in TG 0 Technical Guides Overview, Exhibit III, starting on page 10. ) \\nH.11.  Educational Defined  \\n(1) The term ???charitable??? includes the advancement of education. Like the term \\n???charitable, ??? the IRC doesn???t define the term ??? educational. ??? \\n(2) The term ???educational ??? as used in Section  501(c)(3) , relates to : \\na. The instruction or training of the individual for the purpose of improving or developing his capabilities , or \\nb. The instruction of the public on subjects useful to the individual and beneficial to the community.  \\nSee Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(d)( 3). \\n(3) An organization may be educational even though it advocates a particular position or viewpoint as long as  it provides a sufficiently full and fair \\npresentation of the key facts  as to allow an individual or the public to form an \\nindependent opinion or concl usion. On the other hand, an organization isn??? t \\neducational if its principal function is the mere presentation of unsupported opinion. See Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(d)(3)(i)(b) . \\nSee Technical Guide,  TG 3-5: Exempt Purpose, Educational IRC 501(c)(3)  \\n(Note:  TG 3 -5 will be published in the future. ) -22-   H.12.  Testing for Public Safety Defined  \\n(1) The term ???testing for public safety??? includes the testing of consumer products \\n(such as electrical products ) to determin e whether t hey are safe for use by the \\ngeneral public. See Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) - 1(d)(4).  \\n(2) For detail, see Technical  Guide, TG  3-6: Exempt Purpose, Public Safety, \\nAmateur Athletics, Prevention of Cruelty, and Other IRC 501(c)(3) .  \\n(Note:   TG 3 -6 will be published i n the future. For a list of all TGs published \\nand in process, see the cumulative list of Technical Guides located in TG 0 Technical Guides Overview, Exhibit III, starting on page 10.)  \\nH.13.  Scientific Defined  \\n(1) The terms ???science ??? and ???scientific ??? are not defined in the I RC, Regulations or \\nany published rulings . However, Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(d)( 5) does  provide \\nthat a scientific organization:  \\na. Must be organized and operated in the public interest , \\nb. Includes the carrying on of scientific research in the public interest which \\nfurthers a scientific purpose, and \\nc. Doesn ???t include activi ties of a type ordinarily carried on as incident to \\ncommercial or industrial operations . \\n(2) For detail see Technical Guide, TG   3-4: Exempt Purpose, Scientific  \\nOrganizations,  IRC 501(c)(3) . \\nH.14.  Serving Public Interests  \\n(1) An organization isn???t operated exclusively for exempt purposes if its net earnings inure in whole or in part to the benefit of private shareholders or individuals. In other w ords, if an organization furthers private rather than public \\ninterests, it won???t meet the operational test.  \\n(2) For example, an organization may not be operated for the benefit of private shareholders or individuals . See Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(c)(2).  \\na. In Wendy L. Parker Rehabilitation Foundation, Inc. v. CIR, T.C. Memo.  \\n1986- 348, the court upheld denial of exemption under Section 501(c)(3) \\nbased on inurement. The foundation planned to distribute thirty percent of funds for the care of Wendy Parker (daughter and sister of organization directors/officers). As the distribution of funds for the benefit of Wendy Parker assisted the Parker family in providing for her care, the organization was serving the private interests of the individuals who created it.  \\n(3) Inurement results when an insider (an individual in a relationship with the organization) uses  their position to use the organization???s income or assets for \\npersonal gain.  \\n(4) Private benefit , a term broader than inurement, includes inurement but also \\nresults  when a substantial benefit accrues to an independent outsider.  -23-   (5) The burden of proof is on an organization to establish that it isn???t organized or \\noperated for the benefit of private interests. Therefore, when applying for exemption, an organization must  provide the IRS with documents stating its \\npurposes , rules of oper ation, and a detailed explanation of its operations. See \\nRev. Proc. 2023 -5, 2023- 1 I.R.B. 265 (as updated annually).  \\nII. Adverse Actions and Activities  \\n(1) Adverse actions and activities will be discussed briefly in the following sections.  \\nA. Inurement  \\n(1) For inurement  to exist, an ???insider??? must receive financial gain because of their \\nposition within the exempt organization. Insiders  generally include , but are not \\nlimited to the following:   \\na. Trustees  \\nb. Board members  \\nc. Officers  \\nd. Members  \\ne. Founders  \\nf. Significant donors  \\ng. Emplo yees  \\nh. Individuals with a close professional working relationship with the exempt organization \\n(2) Inurement may exist in many forms. Some examples are:  \\na. Unreasonable compensation  \\nb. Payment of excessive rent  \\nc. Detained or retained interests  \\nd. Receipt  (by the exempt  organization)  of less than fair market values in \\nsales or exchange property  \\ne. Unsecured or inadequately secured loans  \\nf. Prohibitive benefit from funds  \\ng. Exempt organizations providing capital improvements to property  owned \\nby its insiders  \\nh. Copyrights and royalties benefiting insiders  \\ni. Interest free and/or unsecured loans to insiders  \\nj. Dividends  \\n(3) An organization won???t qualify for exemption under Section 501(c)(3) even if a minimal amount of inurement exists because it ser ves private rather than public -24-   purposes and therefore more than an insubstantial part of its activities aren???t in \\nfurtherance of an exempt purpose.  \\n(4) See Technical Guide, TG 3- 8: Disqualifying and Non- Exempt Activities, \\nInurement and Private Benefit IRC 501(c)(3 ), and Technical Guide, TG 3- 65: \\nExcess Benefit Transaction Excise Tax ???  IRC 4958.  (Note: TG 3 -8 will be \\npublished in the future. ) \\nB. Private Benefit  \\n(1) The terms inurement and private benefit are not interchangeable.  \\n(2) Private benefit is broader than inurem ent. All inurement is private benefit but not \\nall private benefit is inurement.  \\n(3) Treas. Reg. 1.501 (c)(3) -1(d)(1)(ii) states that an organization isn???t organized or \\noperated exclusively for exempt purposes unless it serves a public rather than a private interest.  \\n(4) Private benefit will not preclude exemption if it is incidental  to the \\naccomplishment of exempt purposes. However, an activity that primarily serves private interests may jeopardize exempt status if it???s carried on to a degree that???s more than an insubstantial part of the organization???s activities.  \\n(5) To be incidental, private benefit:  \\na. Must be a necessary by -product of the activity that benefits the public at \\nlarge and accomplishes exempt purposes. The benefit to the public can???t be achieved without necessarily benefitting certain private individuals.  \\nSee Rev. Rul. 70- 186, 1970- 1 CB 128, where the organization???s \\npreserv ation of a lake as a public recreational facility was impossible to \\naccomplish without providing benefit to certain private property owners.  \\nb. Must not be substantial relative to the public benefit  the organization \\nprovides . This is a facts and circumstances test that requires public benefit \\nfrom the organization???s activities  to outweigh any individual benefit.  \\nSee Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(d)(1)(iii), Example 2, where the benefit to \\nnoncharitable beneficiaries wasn??? t incidental.  \\n(6) For detail , see Technical G uide, TG 3- 8, Disqualifying and Non- Exempt \\nActivities, Inurement and Private Benefit IRC 501(c)(3).  \\n(Note:  TG 3 -8 will be published in the future. For a list of all TGs published and \\nin process, see the cumulative list of Technical Guides located in TG 0 \\nTechnical Guides Overview, Exhibit III, starting on page 10.)  \\nC. Legislative and Lobbying Activity  \\n(1) An organization w on???t qualify for exemption under Section 501(c)(3) if a \\nsubstantial  part of its activities is attempting to influence legislation (also \\nknown as lobbying) . A Section  501(c)(3) organization may engage in some \\nlobbying, but too much of this activity will result in a denial of exemption or revocation of tax -exempt status.  -25-   (2) Whether an organization???s attempts to influence legislation (lobbying) constitute \\na ???substantial???  part of its overall activities is based on one of two tests.  \\na. The first test is determined based on all of the pertinent facts and \\ncircumstances in each case. G enerally, less than five percent of activities \\nand expenditures is considered insubstantial.  See Seasongood v. Comm\\'r , \\n227 F.2d 907 (6th Cir. 1955) . \\nb. The second test is based on expenditures only;  however, an organization \\nmust elect to be covered by this test . See Section 501(h) and Form 5768, \\nElection/Revocation of Election by an Eligible IRC Section 501(c)(3) Organization \\nto Make Expenditures to Influence Legislation.  \\n(3) Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(c)(3)(ii)(b) define s legislation as including action by \\nCongress, by any state legislature, by any local council or similar governing body, or by the public in a referendum, initiative, constitutional amendment, or similar procedure. \\n(4) Legislation does n???t incl ude the actions of all legislative type bodies. Treas. Reg. \\n56.4911- 2(d)(3) and (4) provide that legislation doesn??? t include actions by:  \\na. Executive, judicial or administrative bodies  \\nb. School boards  \\nc. Housing authorities  \\nd. Sewer and water districts  \\ne. Zoning boards  \\nf. Other similar federal, state, or local special purpose bodies, whether elective or appointive  \\n(5) Lobbying includes direct communications  (direct lobbying)  to legislative \\nmembers and indirect communications (grassroots lobbying) to legislative members through the electorate or general public.  \\n(6) The term ???influencing legislation??? is defined as: \\na. Any attempt to influence legislation through an attempt to affect the opinions  of the general public  \\nb. Any attempt to influence legislation by communication with a member or employee of a legislative body or with a government official or employee who can participate in formulation of legislation ( Section 4911(d)(1) ).  \\n(7) Section 4911(d)((2) describes activities that aren???t considered influencing legislation . These include: \\na. Making available the results of nonpartisan analysis, study, or research \\nb. Providing technical advice or assistance to a governmental body, committee, or subdivision in response to its written request  -26-   c. Making appearances before any legislative body or communi cations with it \\nregarding a possible decision by the body that might affect the exempt \\norganization \\nd. Communicating with its members regarding legislation or proposed \\nlegislation of direct interest to the members  \\ne. Communicating with a government official or employee who is not connected with a legislative body.   \\n(8) An ???action organization???  can???t qualify under Section 501(c)(3). An organization \\nis an ???action organization??? if : \\na. Its main or primary objective is gained only by legislation or a defeat of \\nproposed legis lation, and \\nb. It advocates or campaigns for attainment of its primary objective as \\ndistinguished from  engaging in nonpartisan analysis, study or research \\nand making those results available to the public.  \\na. All facts and circumstances should be considered when making a \\ndetermination. See Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(c)(3)(iv).  \\n(9) Section 501(h) permits certain eligible S ection 501(c)(3) organizations to elect \\nto make limited expenditures to influence legislation.  \\na. Form 5768 must be filed to make an election and revoke an election.  \\nb. An electing organization that spends more than the amounts permitted \\nunder Section 501(h) is subject to an excise tax under S ection 4911.  \\nc. Loss of tax -exempt status can occur if lobbying expenditures exceed the \\npermitted amounts by more than 50% over a 4- year period.  \\n(10)  For detail  see Technical  Guide,  TG 3-9: Disqualifying and Non- Exempt \\nActivities, Political and Lobbying Activities IRC 501(c)(3) . (Note : TG 3 -9 will be \\npublished in the future. For a list of all TGs published and in process, see the cumulative list of Technical Guides located in TG 0 Technical Guides Overview, Exhibit III, starting on page 10.)  \\nD. Political Activity Prohibited  \\n(1) Section 501(c)(3) organizations are prohibited from directly or indirectly \\nparticipating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office.  \\n(2) Contributions to political campaigns or public statements of position (verbal or written) made on behalf of the organization in favor of or in opposition to any candidate for public office violate the prohibition against political campaign activity under S ection 501(c)(3). Violating this prohibition will result in denial of \\nexemption or revocation of tax -exempt status and the imposition of certain \\nexcise taxes.  \\n(3) While some activities and disbursements are obviously polit ical in nature, others \\nmay seem to be political but are actually educational  when conducted in a non --27-   partisan manner . Examples of this include certain voter education activities , \\npresenting public forums , publishing voter education guides, voter registrati on \\nand get -out-the-vote drives.  \\n(4) For detail  see Technical  Guide, TG 3- 9: Disqualifying and Non- Exempt \\nActivities, Political and Lobbying Activities IRC 501(c)(3) . (TG 3 -9 will be \\npublished in the future. For a list of all TGs published and in process, see t he \\ncumulative list of Technical Guides located in TG 0 Technical Guides Overview, \\nExhibit III, starting on page 10.)  \\nE. Carrying on a Trade or Business  \\n(1) For purposes of this section, the following terms are defined:  \\na. Trade or business -  same meaning as it has i n Section 162, and generally \\nincludes any activity carried on for the production of income via the sale of goods or performance of services. See Treas. Reg. 1.513- 1(b). \\nb. Unrelated trade or business -  a trade or business regularly conducted by \\nan exempt organization that is  not substantially related (aside from the \\nneed of such organization for income or funds or the use it makes of the profits derived) to the performance by such organization of its exempt purpose. See Section 513. This definition applies to any organization subject to the tax imposed by Section  511 on unrelated business income.  \\n(2) An organization may meet the requirements of Section 501(c)(3) even though it operates a trade or business as a substantial part of its activities, as long as the operation of such trade or business furthers the organization\\'s exempt purpose(s), and the organization isn???t organized or operated for the primary purpose of carrying on an unrelated trade or business. See Treas. Reg. \\n1.501(c)(3) ???1(e)(1).  \\n(3) The purposes toward which an organization???s activities are directed, and not the nature of the activities will determine whether an organization operating a trade or business can meet the requirements of Section 501(c)(3). See B.S.W. Group, Inc. v. Commissioner, 70 T.C. 352 (1978).  \\n(4) Determining whether an activity serves an exempt purpose while carrying on a trade or business requires considering all the facts and circumstances. The followin g factors are especially important:  \\na. The way the activities are conducted \\nb. The degree the activities are carried on with a \"commercial hue\"  \\nc. Competition with commercial firms  \\nd. The existence and amount of annual or accumulated profits  \\ne. How the organization sets its prices or fees (are they at or below cost, or  \\nat a substantial markup).  \\nSee Living Faith, Inc. v. Commissioner, 950 F.2d 365 (7th Cir. 1991);  Airlie \\nFoundation v. IRS, 283 F.Supp.2d\\n 58 (D.D.C., 2003) . -28-   (5) An organization doesn???t qualify for exemption if an activity serves a substantial \\nnon-exempt purpose. This is true even if  the activity may also further an exempt \\npurpose. For example:  \\nIn Schoger Foundation v. Commissioner, 76 T.C. 380 (1981) , a not -for-profit \\ncorporation was formed to own and operate a mountain lodge as a religious \\nretreat facility. The lodge mad e available to its guests???  numerous activities - \\nreligious, recreational, and social . None of the activities  were  regularly \\nscheduled or required. The religious activities revolved  around individual prayer \\nand contemplation, with optional daily devotions and occasional Sunday \\nservices. The recreational and social activities were of the type usually offered at  \\nvacation resort s. No records were kept showing participation by guests in any of \\nthe activities.  The court held that the organization failed to establish that it was \\noperated exclusively for religious or other exempt purposes within the meaning \\nof Section  501(c) (3). \\n(6) Unrelated trade or business doesn???t include any trade or business:  \\na. In which substantially all the work in carrying on such trade or business is performed for the organization without compensation (volunteer labor \\nexception).  \\nb. Which is carried on (in the case of an organization described in Section 501(c)(3)  or college/ university described in IRC 511(a)(2)(B)), by the \\norganization primarily for the convenience of its members, students, patients, officers, or employees  (cafeteria, campus bookstore, campus \\nhealth clinic) .  \\nc. Which is the selling of merchandise, substantially  all of which has been \\nreceived by the organization as gifts or contributions  (such as thrift stores).   \\nSee Section 513(a) (1)-(3). \\n(7) An organization operated for the primary purpose of carrying on a trade or business shall not be exempt on the ground that al l of its profits are payable to \\nan exempt organization. See Section 502, Feeder Organizations.  \\n(8) For detail s on this subject,  see Technical Guide, TG  48, Unrelated Trade or \\nBusiness and Taxation of Unrelated Business Income.  (Note : TG 48 will be \\npublished in the future. For a list of all TGs published and in process, see the \\ncumulative list of Technical Guides located in TG 0 Technical Guides Overview, Exhibit III, starting on page 10.)  \\nIII. Other Considerations  \\n(1) A number of factors should be considered by organizations applying for tax -\\nexempt status  under Section 501(c)(3) . Some factors concern the application \\nprocess . Others are the organization???s operational responsibilities should tax -\\nexemption be granted.  \\n \\n -29-   A. Foundation  Status \\n(1) Every organization that qualifies for tax -exempt status under Section 501(c)(3) \\nis further classified as either a public charity or a private foundation.  \\n(2) A Section 501(c)(3) organization is generally presumed to be a private \\nfoundation unless  it files a t imely notice to the contrary with the IRS. See \\nSection 508(b) . \\n(3) An organization gives  notice by timely filing a properly completed Form 1023, \\nApplication for Recognition of Exemption Under Section 501(c)(3) of the IRC , or \\nif eligible a Form 1023- EZ, Streaml ined Application for Recognition of \\nExemption Under Section 501(c)(3) of the IRC . Note:  A few types of \\norganizations described in Section 501(c)(3) are excepted from the requirement \\nto file an application. See IRC 508(c).  \\n(4) Section 509(a) defines the term ???private foundation??? to mean any domestic or \\nforeign organization described in Section 501(c)(3) other than an organization \\ndescribed in Section  509(a)(1), (2), (3), or (4). Thus, if an organization is \\ndescribed in S ection 501(c)(3), it is a private foundation (PF) unless it falls into \\none of four general categories of organizations excluded under S ections \\n509(a)(1) through (4) . \\n(5) The following chart lists the categories of organizations excluded from private foundation status  and their  applicable technical guides:  \\nFoundation Status  Internal R evenue Code  Technical Guide * \\nChurch or convention or \\nassociation of churches  509(a)(1) & 170(b)(1)(A)(i)  TG 3 -23: Foundation Status, \\nChurch, IRC 501(c)(3)  \\nSchool  509(a)(1) & 170(b)(1)(A)(ii)  TG 3 -24: Foundation Status, \\nSchool , IRC 501(c)(3)  \\nHospital, cooperative hospital \\nservice organization or a \\nmedical research \\norganization (part of hospital ) 509(a)(1) & 170(b)(1)(A)(iii)  TG 3 -25: Foundation \\nClassification, Hosp ital, IRC \\n501(c)(3)  \\nOrganization operated for the \\nbenefit of a college or \\nuniversity - owned or operated \\nby a governmental unit  509(a)(1) & 170(b)(1)(A)(iv)  TG 3 -27: Foundation Status, \\nOther Non -Private \\nFoundation IRC 509(a)(1) \\nand IRC 170(b)(1)(A)(iv), (v), \\n(ix); and 509(a)(4), IRC \\n501(c)(3)  \\nA governmental unit  \\n 509(a)(1) and 170(b)(1)(A)(v)  \\nNote:  EO Determinations \\ndoes not issue rulings under this section.  \\nSee Rev.

Organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, \\nliterary, or educational purposes, or to foster national or international amateur sports compet ition (but only if no part of its activities involve the \\nprovision of athletic facilities or equipment), or for the prevention of cruelty to children or animals  \\nc. No part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private \\nshareholder or indivi dual, and \\nd. Which isn ???t disqualified for tax exemption under  Section  501(c)(3) by \\nreason of attempting to influence legislation, and which doesn??? t participate \\nin, or intervene in (including the publishing or distributing of statements), any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office.  \\n(3) A contribution or gift by a corporation to a trust, chest, fund, or foundation shall be deductible only  if it???s to be used within the U .S. or any of its possessions -32-   exclusively for purposes specified in Section  170(c)(2)(B). Rules similar to the \\nrules of Section  501(j) shall apply for purposes of this paragraph.   \\n(4) For purposes of Section  170, the term ???charitable contribution??? also means an \\namount treated under Section  170(g), amounts paid to maintain certain \\nstudents as members of taxpayer???s household, as paid for the use of an \\norganization described in Section  170(c)(2), (3), or (4).  \\n(5) A determination letter  or ruling recognizing the exemption of an organization \\nunder Section 501(c)(3) should indicate if the organization is eligible to receive \\ndeductible charitable contributions. For example, an entity organized outside the U.S.,  or its te rritories or possessions isn???t described in Section IRC 170(c) . \\nTherefore, generally the determination letter  for foreign organizations  should \\nindicate that charitable contributions  are not deductible.  \\n(6) Note:  A contribution may be deductible  if provided for by a tax treaty. \\nCurrently, Canada is the only country with a fully implemented tax treat y with \\nthe United States . See United States ???Canada Income Tax Convention, 1986-\\n2 C.B. 258 and Notice 99- 47, 1999- 2 C.B. 391.  \\nC.2. Churches & Section 170 Deductibility  \\n(1) Churches, like many other charitable organizations, qualify for exemption from \\nfederal income tax under Section  501(c)(3) and are generally eligible to \\nreceive tax -deductible contributions  under  Section 170(c)(2).  \\n(2) Churches , however,  are not required to apply for and obtain recognition of tax -\\nexempt status from the IRS. As described below, c hurches that meet the \\nrequirements for Section 501(c)(3) are automatically considered tax -exempt . \\n(3) If a churc h organization wants  recognition of exemption from federal income \\ntax and l isted  in the Pub 78 data as an entity entitled to  receive tax deductible \\ncontributions, it may file an application for exemption.  \\n(4) Under Section 508(a) , an organization organized after October 9, 1969 \\n(except for organizations noted in Section 508(c)), shall not be treated as \\ndescribed in Section  501(c)(3) unless it has given notice to the Service by \\nfiling a properly completed and executed exemption application for recognition \\nof Section  501(c)(3) status. See Treas. Reg. 1.508??? 1(a)(2)(i).   \\n(5) Certain organizations exempt under Section 501(c)(3) are excepted from the \\nSection  508(a) notice requirements:  \\na. Churches, their integrated auxiliaries, and conventions or associations of churches  \\nb. Organizations that normally have gross receipts not in excess of $5,000, and are not private foundations  \\nc. Subordinate organizations (other than private foundations) covered by a group exemption letter . -33-   C.3. Foreign Organizations & Section 170 Deductibility  \\n(1) Accor ding to Section 170(c)(2), c haritable contributions by donors  to \\norganizations formed either outside the U.S. or under foreign law  are not \\ndeductible.  Canada has a fully implemented tax treaty with the United States.) \\nUnited States ???Canada Income Tax Convention, 1986- 2 C.B. 258  and Notice \\n99-47, 1999- 2 C.B. 391.  \\n(2) Under certain tax treaties, contributions to foreign organizations may be \\ndeductible to a limited extent . Generally, tax treaties limit deductibility to the \\napplicable percentage of the taxpayer???s income derived from the treaty -\\npartner.  \\n(3) A contribution to a charitable organization in a country with a fully implemented tax treaty may be claimed as a charitable deduction to the extent allowed by \\nthe treaty , even though the organization hasn??? t applied for recognition of \\nexemption in the U .S. Canada is currently the only country with a fully \\nimplemented tax treaty with the U.S.  See Notice 99- 47, 1999- 2 C.B. 391.  \\n(4) An organization in a country that has a tax treaty that is not fully implemented through a competent authority agreement can receive deductible contributions to the extent allowed by the particular treaty if it establishes its exempt status with the IRS.  \\n(5) Contributions to charitable organizations formed in U.S. territories are deductible by donors. See IRC 170(c)(2).  \\nC.4. Contributions to Dome stic Organizations with Foreign \\nActivities \\n(1) If a domestic organization transmits its funds to a foreign private organization but retains the requisite control and discretion over the funds , it qualifies for \\nrecognition of exemption under Section 501(c)(3) . Contributions to it will be \\ndeductible under Section 170(c)(2).  See Example 4 or Example 5 of Rev. Rul. \\n63-252, 1963- 2 C.B. 101 and Rev. Rul. 66 -79, 1966- 1 C.B. 48.  \\n(2) However, if a domestic organization, otherwise qualified under Section \\n501(c)(3), transmits  its funds to a private organization not described in Section \\n501(c)(3) and fails to exercise, or has too little, discretion and control over the use of such funds , the domestic organization forfeits its qualification for \\nexempt status because it can???t dem onstrate that it???s operated exclusively for \\ncharitable purposes . The contributions to it aren???t deductible.  \\nD. Other Benefits of Tax Exemption  \\n(1) In addition to exemption from the payment of federal income tax and the general deductibility of charitable contributions, Section 501(c)(3)  organizations  \\nmay enjoy other benefits under the IRC, as well as under state or local income, property, sales, use, or other tax provisions.  -34-   D.1. State, Local, Employment and Excise Tax Benefits  \\n(1) Many state and local jurisdictions accept the IRS???s determination for their own \\nexemption requirements or require exemption from federal income tax under Section 501(c)(3) as a prerequisite to granting exemption under state or local provisions.  \\na. To promote efficient enforcement of separate tax laws, Section 6104(c) \\nprovides an exception to the general confidentiality provisions of Section 6103. The exception allows the Service to share information with \\nappropriate state officials including in situations where  organizations have \\nbeen denied recognition of exemption under Section 501(c)(3) or have had their exemption under Section 501(c)(3) revoked.  \\nb. Some organizations may also enjoy exemption from certain federal excise taxes (for example, telephone excise tax ). \\nD.2. Other Benefits  \\n(1) Religious, educational, scientific, and philanthropic (charitable) organizations \\nare eligible to mail at preferred postal rates. However,  not all Section 501(c)(3) \\norganizations are eligible. Qualifying organizations must apply to the Uni ted \\nStates Postal Service for consideration of these preferred rates.  See USPS, \\nPublication 417, Nonprofit USPS Marketing Mail Eligibility : Nonprofit and Other \\nQualified Organizations.  \\n(2) Section 501(c)(3)  organizations  can offer their employees the benefit of \\nspecial annuity tax provisions under Section 403(b).  \\n(3) Section 501(c) organizations can offer their  employees qualified Section \\n457(b)  deferred compensation plans. Note: Churches and qualified church-\\ncontrolled organizations as defined in Section 3121(w) (A) and (B)  are not \\neligible employers. See Treas. Reg. 1.457- 2(e). \\n(4) Exempt organizations can also maintain qualified Section 401(k) plans and adopt qualified profit -sharing plans under Section 401(a)(27) for their \\nemployees.  \\nE. Interaction with Section 4958  \\n(1) Section  4958 imposes  excise taxes on persons engaging in excess benefit \\ntransactions with an applicable tax -exempt organization.  Those taxes include:  \\na. A tax equal to 25 percent of the excess benefit on a disqualified person \\nwho engages in excess benefit transactions with an applicable tax -exempt \\norganization. See Section 4958(a)(1).  \\nb. A tax equal to 10 percent  of the excess benefit on the participation of any \\norganization manager involved in the excess benefit transaction unless participation is not willful and is due to reasonable cause.  See Section \\n4958(a)(2).  -35-   c. An additional tax equal to 200 percent  on the dis qualified person if the \\nexcess benefit involved in the transaction at issue is not corrected within \\nthe taxable period.  See Section 4958(b).  \\n(2) An ???excess benefit transaction??? means any transaction in which an:                 \\na. Economic benefit is provided by an applicable tax -exempt organization \\ndirectly or indirectly to or for the use of any disqualified person, and  \\nb. The value of the e conomic benefit provided exceeds the value of the \\nconsideration (including the performance of services) received for providing the benefit . See Section 4958(c)(1).  \\n(3) Section 4958(f)(1) defines disqualified person as:  \\na. Any person who was in a position to exercise substantial influence over \\nthe affairs of the organization, at any time during the 5- year period ending \\non the date of the transaction (look -back period)  \\nb. A person involved with a related 509(a)(3) supporting organization  \\nc. A person involved in a transaction with a donor advised fund \\nd. A member of a disqualified person???s family  \\ne. A 35-percent controlled entity . \\n(4) Section 4958 imposes penalties on the offending individuals (disqualified \\npersons, organizational managers) rather than on the exempt organization \\nitself. \\n(5) However, Section 4958 need not be the only sanction imposed on an excess benefit transaction. An organization???s ex empt status may still be subject to \\nrevocation, for instance, if appropriate.  \\nF. Financial Support Provided to  Other Organizations  \\n(1) Many charitable organizations don???t engage in active charitable undertakings \\nthemselves . Instead, they assist the work of religious, charitable, educational, or \\nsimilar organizations by contributing money to them through grantmaking, indirect support, and support through nonexempt organizations. For example:  \\na. Grantmaking organizations are sometimes controlled by corporate and individual taxpayers who use them as channels for their charitable \\ncontributions. Some have very large endowments and make grants totaling millions of dollars annually.  \\nSee Rev. Rul. 67- 149, 1967- 1 C.B. 133.  \\nb. An organization formed to construct and maintain a building to house member agencies of a community chest may be providing a form of indirect support of charitable activities.  \\nSee Rev. Rul. 69- 572, 1969- 2 C.B. 119.  \\nc. Some charitable organizations make distributions to nonexempt organizations. These funds must  be used for specific projects that further -36-   the purposes of the charitable organization. The charitable organization \\nmust retain discretion and control over the use of the funds and maintain records establishing that the funds are used for charitable purposes.  \\nSee Rev. Rul. 68- 489, 1968- 2 C.B. 210.  \\n(2) Exempt organizations described in Section 501(c)  other than those described in \\nSection 501(c)(3), often engage in a limited amount of charitable activities in addition to their program activity. A Section 501(c)( 3) may support the non-\\nSection 501(c)(3) charitable activities by providing funding or goods to carry  out \\nthose charitable activities as long as control and documentation of the use for charitable purposes can be secured. A Section 501(c)(3) organization, however, \\nshould be cautious when supporting the charitable activities of non- Section \\n501(c)(3)  organization s as to not jeopardize its  own tax-exempt status.  \\nG. Government Instrumentalities  \\n(1) There is no provision in the IRC that imposes a tax on the income of \\ngovernmental units. The term ???governmental units??? refers to the states and their political subdivisions. The income of governmental units  isn???t generally subject \\nto federal income taxation. See Section 115.  \\n(2) The income of a separately organized entity that is n???t an integral part of a state \\ngovernment or a political subdivision is subject to tax, unless an  exemption or \\nan exclusion applies. These organizations are referred to as ???instrumentalities.???  \\n(3) The term ???instr umentality??? of a governmental unit doesn??? t appear in Section 501. \\nIt is, however, referenced in the IRC applying the FICA and FUTA employment \\ntaxes  under Section 3126.  \\n(4) In addition to the other requirements for Section 501(c)(3), an instrumentality must sat isfy both of the following to qualify under Section 501(c)(3):  \\na. A separate organization requirement  \\nb. No sovereign powers requirement , which are police, tax, eminent domain.   \\nSee Rev. Rul. 60- 384, 1960- 2 C.B. 172.  \\nG.1.  Separate Organization Requirement \\n(1) The separate organization requirement is generally met if the entity is incorporated under state non- profit corporation law.  A corporation is a legal \\nentity, created under the authority of the laws of a state, which is regarded as having an existence completely separate and apart from that of its creators and constituents.  \\n(2) A trust is also a separate organization.  A trust is defined as: \\nAn arrangement created either by a will or by an inter -vivos \\ndeclaration where trustees take title to property to protect or conserve it for the beneficiaries under the ordinary rules applied in chancery or probate courts. An arrangement will be treated as a trust if it can be shown that the purpose is to vest in trustees???\\n responsibility  for the \\nprotection and conservation of property for beneficiaries who cannot -37-   share in the discharge of this responsibility and, therefore, are not \\nassociates in a joint enterprise for the conduct of business for profit.  \\nSee Treas. Reg. 301.7701- 4(a).  \\n(3) Section 7701(a)(3) states that the term ???corporation??? includes associations. \\nThus, an association may be considered a corporation for federal tax purposes (as determined under Treas. Reg. 301.7701- 3). Any entity that ???s a \\n???corporation??? for federal tax law purposes will be considered separately organized, even if it is not incorporated under state law.  \\n(4) An organization established pursuant to a state statute, satisfies the \\norganizational requirements of Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(b) by s ufficiently \\ndescribing its operations  (stated purposes) . See 1996 EO CPE F. State \\nInstitutions ??? Instrumentalities. ???[I]f a careful reading of an instrumentality???s \\nenabling document clearly shows that it will operate exclusively for exempt purposes, it will be deemed to have met that por tion of the organizational test.???  \\n(5) A business entity wholly owned by a State or any political subdivision, or a \\nbusiness entity wholly owned by a foreign government,  or any other entity \\ndescribed in Treas. R eg. 1.892- 2T is treated as a corporation. See Treas. \\nReg. 301.7701- 2(b)(6).  \\n(6) Entities considered ???separately organized??? include colleges and universities , \\nhospital s, housing, or development authorities , public library boards , water or \\npark districts , public s chool athletic as sociations , charitable trusts , and \\norganizations created by inter -governmental agreement.   \\nG.2. Powers Other than those Described in Section 501(c)(3)  \\n(1) An instrumentality that exercises substantial regulatory or enforcement powers \\nin the public interest  (such as health, welfare, or safety),  won???t  qualify  for \\nexemption.  \\n(2) Powers of regulation or enforcement are powers which are possessed by governmental agencies such as school boards  and boards of health and \\nwelfare. These powers are referred to as  sovereign powers.  \\n(3) There are three generally acknowledged sovereign powers : \\na. Police power  \\nb. Power to tax  \\nc. Power of eminent domain.  \\n(4) The presence of either the police power or the power to tax, if substantial, will  \\ndisqualify a separately  organized government entity from exemption under \\nSection 501(c)(3).  See Rev. Rul. 60 -384, 1960- 2 C.B. 172.  \\n(5) Also, a n organization having investigatory powers which are regulatory  or \\nenforcement powers of the kind referred to in Rev. Rul. 60- 384, won???t qualify \\nfor exemption. See Rev. Rul. 74 -14, 1974- 1 C.B. 125.  -38-   (6) There is no distinction between the power to recommend or certify a tax rate, \\nthe power to determine a tax rate, and the power to levy, assess, or impose a tax. The regulatory or  enforcement power lies with the power to collect  - not \\nthe power to certify or levy a tax rate. Thus, if an organization has the power to collect tax, it  won???t qualify for exemption.  \\n(7) Organizations without substantial sovereign powers won???t be disqualified from exemption since they don???t  indicate purposes beyond those qualifying as \\nexclusively exempt under Section 501(c)(3).  Organizations with insubstantial \\nsovereign powers are not disqualified from exemption. For example, a state university with a police force that regulates traffic, mot or vehicles and speed \\nlimits on campus, issues citations, imposes fines and arrests persons to detain them until city police arrives, is not disqualified from exemption because its police powers are insubstantial and limited to its campus. See Rev. Rul. 77-165, 1977- 1 C.B. 21.  \\n(8) Although the power of eminent domain is clearly  a sovereign power, it is not \\nnecessarily a power of regulation or enforcement within the meaning of Rev. Rul. 60 -384 and may not disqualify a separately organized government entity \\nfrom exemption. See Rev. Rul. 67 -290, 1967- 2 C.B. 183.  \\n(9) If the power of eminent domain is combined with other powers to give an organization purpose broader than those described in Section 501(c)(3), then \\nthe organization does n???t qualify for exemption. For example, if an organization, \\nin addition to condemning property by the power of eminent domain, has the power to conduct investigations, hear testimony and take proof under oath, issue subpoenas, and recommend standards of maintenance and \\nrequirements of applic able health and safety ordinances and zoning, it does n???t \\nqualify.  \\nG.3. Dissolution Provisions  \\n(1) Many instrumentalities have language in their governing instrument providing that upon dissolution, all remaining assets will be distributed to a state or any politica l subdivision thereof to satisfy Section 115 requirements. This raises a \\npotential problem, as Treas. Reg. Section 1.501(c)(3) -1(b)(4) requires that \\nupon dissolution assets be distributed to the Federal government, or to a State or local government, for a public purpose.  \\n(2) However, if the organization has been created by a state statute, local ordinance, or similar enabling vehicle, and there is no indication that upon dissolution the assets will be distributed for private use, then it can be considered to s atisfy the dissolution requirements without explicitly including \\nthe phrase ???for a public purpose,??? which would normally be required.  \\nG.4. Section 115 Exclusion  \\n(1) Section 115(1) states,  ???gross income does not include income derived from \\nany public utility or the exercise of any essential governmental function and accruing to a State or any political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia.???  -39-   (2) Activities that involve exercise of an ???essential government function??? for \\nSection 115 purposes are generally determined on a case- by-case basis. \\nSome factors to consider whether an activity is considered governmental include the involvement of sovereign powers, the extent of governmental control over the activity, and the extent of governmental financial interest i n the \\nactivity.  \\n(3) In order for a government entity to receive a determination of its status as a political subdivision, instrumentality of government, or whether its revenue is excluded under Section 115, it must obtain a letter ruling by following the \\nprocedures specified in Revenue Procedure 2023- 1, 2023 -1 I.R.B. 1  (updated \\nannually) . There is a user fee for obtaining a letter ruling.  \\n(4) The fact that an organization???s income may be excluded under Section 115(1) does n???t preclude it from also qualifying for ex emption under Section 501(c)(3).  \\nH. Native American Tribal Governments \\n(1) Before 1983, Native American governments were not tr eated similarly to state \\nor local governments under the IRC . Although tribal governments weren??? t \\nsubject to tax (Rev. Rul. 67- 284, 1967- 2 C.B. 55), the favorable consequences \\navailable to private parties entering into transactions with state governments didn???t apply to similar transactions with Native American tribal governments.  \\n(2) Congress sought to equalize this treatment by enacting Sect ions 7701(a)(40) \\nand 7871 which  provides that for certain specified federal tax purposes, an \\nIndian tribal government shall be treated as a State.  \\nH.1. Terms Defined for Native American Tribal Governments   \\n(1) Indian tribal government  - the governing body of any tribe, band, community, \\nvillage, or group of Indians, or (if applicable) Alaska Natives, which is determined by the Secretary, after consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, to exercise governmental functions.  Section 7701(a)(40)(A) .  \\n(2) Governmental function - not defined under Section 7701(a)(40) or Section \\n7871, but legislative history shows  that Congress considered the term  \\n???governmental function??? to be synonymous  with the term ???sovereign powers.??? \\nIn addition, Treas. Reg. ?? 305.7871- 1(d) defines the term ???essential \\ngovernmental function??? for purposes of section 7871 as a function of a type which is  \\na. Eligible for funding under 25 U.S.C. Section  13 (relating to expenditures \\nby the Bureau of Indian Affairs)  \\nb. Eligible for grants or contracts under 25 U.S.C. 450(f), (g), and (h), or  \\nc. An essential governmental function under section 115  \\n(3) Political subdivision ???  not defined under Section 7701(a)(40) or Section 7871, \\nbut legislative history indicates that the determination of an entity???s status as a \\npolitical subdivision of an Indian tribal government is to be based on the same -40-   criteria as has traditionally been applied to determine an entity???s status as a \\npolitical subdivision of a state under Section 103.  \\nFor purposes specified in Section 7871(a), a subdivision of an Indian tribal \\ngovernment shall be treated as a political subdivision of a state if (and only if) the Secretary of the Treasury determines (after consultation with the Secretary of the Interior) that such subdivision has been delegated the right to exercise one or more of the substantial governmental functions of the Indian tribal government.  Section 7871(d) . \\nTreas. Reg. 1. 103-1(b) defines a political subdivision as any division of any \\nstate or local government unit which is a municipal corporation, or which has been delegated the right to exercise part of the sovereign power of the unit.  \\nH.2. Recognized Tribal Entities and Subdivisions \\n(1) Indian tribal entities recognized as Indian tribal governments and subdivisions of Indian tribal governments r ecognized as political subdivisions aren??? t subject \\nto federal income tax on amounts derived from performing their tribal functions. This non- tax treatment is derived from the Service???s long -standing \\nposition, set forth in Rev. Rul. 67- 284, 1967- 2 C.B. 55. Under this revenue \\nruling an Indian tribal government is not a taxable entity . It won???t qualify for  \\nSection 501(c)(3) exemption. It is simply not taxed.  \\n(2) Rev. Proc. 2008- 55, 2008 2 C.B. 768, designates the entities that appear on \\nthe current or future lists  of federally recognized Indian tribes published \\nannually by the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, as Indian tribal governments for purposes of section 7701(a)(40). Indian tribal governments are treated as States for certain purposes under section 7871(a).   \\n(3) Rev. Proc. 84- 36, 1984- 1 C.B. 510,  lists the recognized subdivisions of Indian \\ntribal governments to be treated as political subdivisions of states for specified purposes under the Code for a two- year period. Subsequently, Rev. Proc. 86-\\n17, 1986- 1 C.B. 550 deleted the two- year limitation.  \\n(4) Rev. Proc.  84-37, 1984- 1 C.B. 513, as modified by Rev. Proc. 2023- 1, 2023- 1 \\nI.R.B 1  (updated annually), provides guidance on how a governmental unit of \\nan Indian tribe or a political subdivision of an Indian tribal government not included among those listed in Revenue Procedures previously published by the IRS can request a determination qualifying it for treatment as a state or a \\npolitical subdivision of a state as provided under S ection 7871.  \\nH.3. Other Indian Tribal Organizations  \\n(1) The Service has processed applications  from a variety of Native American \\nrelated organizations, including:  \\na. A tribal corporation organized under S ection 17 of the Indian \\nReorganization Act of 1934  \\nb. A separately organized entity created under state law by a tribal government  -41-   c. A separately organized entity created by a tribal government recognized \\nby a particular State but not the Federal government  \\nd. A tribal government believed to qualify for treatment as a state or a political subdivision of a state for purposes of Section 7871 and 7701(a)(40).  \\n(2) A Native American tribal corporation, organized under Section 17 of the \\nIndian Reorganization Act of 1934, 25 U.S.C. Section 477 i , is not subject to \\nfederal income tax on the income earned in the conduct of commercial business on or off the tribe\\'s reservati on. However, a corporation organized by \\nan Indian tribe under state law  is subject to federal income tax on the income \\nearned in the conduct of commercial business on and off the tribe\\'s reservation.  See Rev. Rul. 94- 16, 1994- 1 C.B. 19  \\n(3) A Native American tribal corporation, organized under Section 17 of the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, 25 U.S.C. Section 477: or under Section \\n3 of the Oklahoma Welfare Act  \\na. Doesn ???t qualify for exemption as described under Section 501(c)(3) but is \\nsimply not subject to federal income tax.   \\nb. Doesn???t owe federal income tax  regardless of the location of the business \\nactivities that produced the income (either on or off the tribe???s reservation) . \\nSee Rev. Rul s. 94- 16, 1994- 1 C.B. 19 and 94- 65, 1994- 2 C.B. 14.  \\n(4) However, a corporation organized by an Indian tribe under state law   \\na. Is subject to federal income tax on a ny income earned by such \\ncorporation, regardless of the location of the business activities that produced the income (either on or off the reservation), is subject to federal income tax . See Rev. Rul. 94- 16.  \\nb. May qualify for exemption from federal income tax if it conducts charitable \\nand educational activities as a corporation separate from the tribe. Such activities may include tribal history research, cultural activities, and self -\\nhelp projects for tribe members who are located in areas of economic blight and living on incomes below the poverty level. These charitable and educational activities are often conducted by an organization as part of  an \\neffort to be recognized as an Indian tribe by the federal government. As obtaining tribal recognition usually entails historical documentation, but not political or legislative activity, this activity won??? t disqualify an organization \\nfrom obtaining recognition under Section 501(c)(3).  \\n(5) A separately organized entity created by a tribal government that is recognized by a particular State but not the federal government may qualify for exemption from federal income tax if it otherwise meets the organizational and operational tests of Section 501(c)(3), including the absence of substantial sovereign powers.  \\n(6) If an application from a tribal entity is denied under Section 501(c)(3), but it appears that the entity will qualify for treatment as an Indian tribal government -42-   or as a political subdivision of an Indian tribal government for purposes of \\nSection 7871 and 7701(a)(40), the denial should advise that a formal \\ndetermination of status may be requested pursuant to Rev. Proc s. 84- 37, \\n1984- 1 C.B. 513 and 2023- 1, 2023 -1 I.R.B. 1 (updated annually).  \\nI. Foreign Organizations  \\n(1) Foreign organizations may  seek recognition of  exemption under Section \\n501(c)(3) even if they have no U.S. taxable income. The Service will recognize \\ntheir exempt status if they meet the same requirements applicable to domestic organizations.  \\n(2) Foreign organizations that meet the requirements of Section 501(c)(3) may \\nestablish exemption from U .S. income tax or establish their charitable status for \\npurposes of the estate and gift taxes  or other purposes . However, apart from \\ntreaty provisions, contributions to foreign charities are not deductible under Section 170(c).  \\n(3) Some foreign charitable organizations may be eligible for recognition of exemption based on a specific provision in a tax treaty their country has with the U .S. However, treaties that provide for \"reciprocal recognition\" generally \\nrequire that  the countries agree in a separate agreement that their exemption \\nstandards are comparable, or establish the scope of recognition, before the treaty takes effect.  \\n(4) Currently, Canada is the only country in which charitable organizations recognized  as exempt from income tax  by a foreign government are recognized \\nexempt under Section 501(c)(3) without applying to the Service (see United States -Canada Income Tax Convention (Treaty), Article XXI  and Notice 99- 47, \\n1999- 36 I.R.B. 392). However, Canadian charities are presumed to be private \\nfoundations and must request a determination from the IRS if they want to be considered a public charity . Canadian charities can request the public charity \\nclassification on Form 8940, Request for miscellaneous determinations. One benefit of public charity status is eligib ility for the 50 percent limit on \\ncontributions.  \\n(5) Unless excepted by provisions of a tax treaty, a foreign organization seeking recognition of exemption under Section 501(c)(3) must file an application on Form 1023, Application for Recognition of Exemption Under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code,  in the same manner as a domestic organization.  \\n(6) Organizations formed under the laws of a foreign country, or with a mailing \\naddress in a foreign country are not  eligible to file Form 1023- EZ, Streamlined \\nApplication for Recognition of Exemption Under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (See Instructions for Form 1023- EZ, Eligibility Worksheet) .  \\n(7) Contributions to charitable foreign organizations general ly are not deductible in \\ncomputing U.S. income tax. Under Section 170(c)(2)(A), charitable contributions by donors to organizations formed outside the U.S. and under foreign law aren???t deductible. However, under certain tax treaties, contributions to forei gn \\norganizations may be deductible to a limited extent. Generally, tax treaties limit -43-   deductibility to the applicable percentage of the taxpayer???s income derived from \\nthe treaty -partner.  Currently, Canada is the only country with a fully \\nimplemented tax tr eated with the United States.)  \\nIV. Application for Recognition of Exemption and Return \\nRequirements  \\n(1) Certain rules and procedures apply to organizations seeking recognition of exemption. The following will explain the procedures to obtain a determination letter recognizing an organization???s exemption under Section 501(c)(3).  \\n(2) Most exempt organizations (including private foundations) must file various returns, forms , or reports at some time during (or following the close of) their \\nfiscal year . Additionally, each organization???s state of formation has specific \\nreporting requirements . \\nA. Application for Recognition of Exemption  \\n(1) A charitable organization generally w on???t be treated as tax -exempt unless it \\napplies for recognition of exemption by filing a current application for exemption form.  \\n(2) Applications for exemption are processed by the Tax Exempt /Government \\nEntities Division, Exempt Organizations  (EO), Rulings and Agreements -\\nDeterminations.  The EO Determinations unit is responsible for reviewing \\napplications.  \\nA.1. Section 508(a) Notice \\n(1) Under Section 508(a), an organization organized after October 9, 1969 (except for organizations noted in Section 508(c)), shall not be treated as described in Section 501(c)(3) unless it has given notice to the IRS in the \\nmanner prescribed by regulations  that it???s applying for recognition of Section \\n501(c)(3) status. This is commonly referred to as the 508(a) notice.  \\n(2) Notice is given by submi tting a properly completed and executed exemption \\napplication Form 1023, Application for Recognition of Exemption Under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, or  if applicable, Form 1023-\\nEZ, Streamlined Application for Recognition of Exemption Under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code). Treas. Reg. 1.508??? 1(a)(2)(i).  \\n(3) Rev. Rul. 77 -114, 1977- 1 C.B. 152 provides that t he date of notice for \\npurposes of Code section 508(a) (the requirement to file Form 1023) is the date of the U.S. postmark st amped on the cover in which an exemption \\napplication is mailed or, if no postmark appears on the cover, the date the application is stamped as received by the Service.  Form 1023, Application for \\nRecognition of Exemption Under Section 501(c)(3) of the Inter nal Revenue \\nCode, or if applicable, Form 1023- EZ, Streamlined Application for Recognition \\nof Exemption Under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code)  are \\nsubmitted electronically. Notice is given by submitting a completed electronic application  -44-   (4) The application must be filed within 15 months  from the end of the month in \\nwhich the organization was organized. Treas. Reg. 1.508??? 1(a)(2)(i) . However, \\nan automatic 12- month extension to the 15- month period is provided by Treas. \\nReg. 301.9100??? 2(a)(2)(iv).  \\n(5) If a taxpayer fails to file an application within 27 months (filing requirement of \\n15 months plus the automatic 12- month extension), Treas. Reg. 301.9100- 3 \\nprovides rules for requesting an extension of time. A request for relief will be \\ngranted the taxpayer if the taxpayer can provide evidence (including required affidavits) that:  \\na. The organization acted reas onably  and in good faith to  make the \\napplication, and \\nb. Granting the relief will not prejudice the government???s interests.  However, \\nsee item 6 below.  \\n(6) An organization will not be granted relief under Treas. Reg. ?? 301.9100- 3 if \\neither:  \\na. Granting relief would result in the organization???s tax -exempt status being \\nautomatically revoked under section 6033(j)(1) effective before the application date (without regard to the provisions of section 6033(j)(3)), or  \\nb. The period of limitations on assessment under section 6501(a) for any taxable year for which the organization claims tax -exempt status has \\nexpired prior to the date of application.  \\n  See Rev. Proc. 2023- 5, 2023- 1 I.R.B. 265 (updated annually).  \\n(7) If an organization does not file a timely application,  or is not granted relief \\nunder Treas. Reg. 301.9100- 3, it will not be exempt prior to the time it filed its \\napplication. See Section 508(a). Nor will it have other privileges of exemption \\nfrom federal income tax such as exemption from federal unemployment taxes  \\n(FUTA) for the prior period. ( . See Rev. Rul. 76 ???262, 1976??? 2 C.B. 310.  Note: \\nThe ruling discusses exemption from federal insurance contributions act \\n(FICA)  taxes . Beginning January 1, 1984,  P. Law 98- 21., provides that all  \\n501(c)(3) organizations are subject to FICA .  \\n(8) An \"incomplete\" application doesn???t  constitute notice under Section 508(a). \\nHowever, an application isn???t incomplete merely because it needs to be \\nperfected. A completed application may need additional information before a \\ndetermination of exempt status may be made. In such cases , the notic e \\nrequirement of Section 508(a) has been met whether or not the additional information is timely received. However, absence of the following information \\nwill cause an application (other than Form 1023- EZ application)  to be \\nincomplete:  \\na. Copy of the articles of organization \\nb. Copy of the bylaws or internal rules of operation -45-   c. Balance sheet for most recently completed tax year  (or the most current \\ninformation available if a full tax year has not been completed.)  \\nd. Statement of receipts and expenditures  (if in existence  less than one year \\n??? provide projections for current year and next two years , if in existence \\nmore than one year but less than five, provide actual income and \\nexpenses for past years and good faith estimates for future years for a \\ntotal of four ye ars, if in existence for five years or more, provide actual \\nincome and expenses for the five most recently completed tax years.   \\ne. Any other basic data required by the application or its instructions . See \\nRev. Proc. 2023- 5, 2023- 1 I.R.B. 265, updated annually and Instructions \\nto Form 1023.  \\n(9) An incomplete application will be considered timely filed if the organization \\nsupplies the necessary additional information requested by the Service within \\nthe additional time period provided for in the request.  See Treas. Reg. 1.508???\\n1(a)(2)(ii).  \\n(10) Procedures for the issuance of determination letters on issues under the \\njurisdiction of the Director, Exempt Organizations (EO) Rulings and Agreements , as well as guidance on applicable user fees for requesting \\ndetermination letters  are found in Rev. Proc. 2023 -5, 2023 -1 I.R.B.  265 \\n(updated annually) .  \\nA.2. Application Forms  \\n(1) Form 1023,  Application for Recognition of Exemption Under Section 501(c)(3) \\nof the IRC, to apply for  exempt status under S ection 501(c)(3) . A user fee is \\nneeded to process the application.  \\n(2) Some organizations may be eligible to file Form 1023- EZ, Streamlined \\nApplica tion for Recognition of Exemption Under Section 501(c)(3) of the IRC. \\nTo decide eligibility, the Eligibility Worksheet in the Instructions for Form 1023-\\nEZ must be completed prior to completing Form 1023- EZ. See section VII I. \\nExhibit, A Form 1023- EZ Eligib ility Worksheet : \\n(3) Both Form 1023 and Form 1023- EZ are available on pay.gov.  To file:  \\na. Register for an account on Pay.gov  (enter the term ???Form 1023??? or \"Form \\n1023- EZ\" in the search box).  More information about Form 1023- EZ and \\nits filing can be found on www.irs.gov/charities -non-profits/applying -for-\\ntax-exempt -status.  \\nb. Pay t he required user fee through Pay.gov when the application is filed (by \\ncredit card or bank account).  \\n(4) User fees are l isted in Rev. Proc.  2023- 5, Appendix A (updated annually).  \\nA.3. Application Processing   \\n(1) The IRS tax specialist reviewing an application may request additional information in writing. If all information received establishes that an -46-   organization meets the requir ements for exemption, the IRS will issue a \\ndetermination letter recognizing the organization???s exempt status and \\nproviding its foundation classification. This is an important document that should be kept in the organization???s permanent records.  \\n(2) While an or ganization???s application is waiting for processing by the IRS, the \\norganization may operate as a tax -exempt organization.  \\n(3) Most organizations are required to file an annual information return (Form 990, Form 990- EZ or Form 990- PF) or electronic notice (Form  990-N) while their \\napplication for exemption is pending. An organization???s exempt status can be automatically revoked while its application is pending if it hasn??? t filed a required \\nreturn or notice for three consecutive tax periods after its formation dat e. \\nThese returns are subject to public disclosure.  \\n(4) If an organization has unrelated business income of more than $1,000, it must \\nalso file a Form 990- T, Exempt Organization Business Income Tax Return.  \\n(5) Although donors have no assurance that contributions are tax -deductible for \\nfederal income tax purposes until the application is approved, contributions made while an application is pending would qualify if the application is approved. However, if the application is denied, contributions wouldn??? t qualify. \\nMoreover, the organization would be liable for filing federal income tax returns \\nunless its income is otherwise excluded from federal taxation.  \\n(6) The IRS  will consider a  complete application and will issue a favorable \\ndetermination letter, an adverse letter denying the exempt status requested in the application or, may close the case without deciding if there is no r esponse  \\nto a request for additional information. The IRS  will also close a case without a \\ndetermination if the request  is withdrawn . \\n(7) See Publication 4221- PC, Compliance Guide for 501(c)(3) Public Charities, or \\n4221- PF, Compliance Guide for 501(c)(3) Private Foundations, for more \\ninformation.  \\nA.4. Adverse Determinati ons - Appeal Procedures, Administrative \\nRemedies and Judicial Remedies  \\n(1) A proposed adverse determination letter will be issued to an organization that hasn??? t provided sufficiently detailed information to establish that it qualifies for \\nexemption or if the information provided establishes that it doesn\\'t qualify for exemption. An organization can appeal a proposed adverse determination letter.  \\n(2) Appeals Procedures : \\nAn organization will be advised of its rights to protest the adverse \\ndetermination by requesting Independent Office of Appeals (Appeals) \\nconsideration. The organization must submit a statement of its views fully \\nexplaining its reasoning. The statement must be submitted within 30 days from the date of the proposed adverse determination letter and must  state whether \\nthe organization wants to protest the proposed determination.  For more -47-   information about the role of App eals, see Publication 892, How to Appeal an \\nIRS Decision on Tax -Exempt Status.  \\n(3) After any requested conference and upon consideration of t he organization\\'s \\nappeal (as well as information presented in any conference held) , Appeals will \\ngenerally notify the organization of its decision and issue an appropriate \\ndetermination letter. An adverse decision can be appealed to the courts. If new information is submitted during Appeals ??? consideration, the matter may be \\nreturned to Rulings and Agreements for further consideration.  \\n(4) Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies:  \\nSection 7428 allows organizations to seek judicial relief from an adverse determination from the IRS. Before seeking relief from the Courts, the organization must first exhaust its administrative remedies. Note:  Churches do not have to exhaust administrat ive remedies before appealing an IRS \\ndetermination to the Courts. See Section 7611(g).)  \\n(5) Matters that may be appealed to the Court after administrative remedies are exhaust ed include:  \\na. The initial and continuing qualification of an organization described in in Section 501(c)(3) which is exempt from tax under Section 501(a)  \\nb. Initial and continual classification of foundation status under Section 509(a).  \\nc. Initial and continual classification as a private operating foundation as defined in Section 4942(j)(3). (Note: Other categories of determinations outside the scope of this TG  are covered by the remedies of Section 7428. \\nSee Section 7428 for the full list.)  \\n(6) The following are administrative remedies that should be exhausted before \\nseeking relief from the Court.  \\na. Filing of the correct completed application or group exemption request or \\nfiling of request for a determination of foundation status  \\nb. For a late filed application, requesting relief under Treas. Reg. 301.9100- 3 \\nregarding applications for extensions of time for making an election or application for relief from tax  \\nc. Timely submission of all additional information requested to perfect an \\nexemption application or request for determination of private foundation \\nstatus . \\nd. Exhaustion of all administrative appeals avai lable within the IRS.  \\n(7) The administrative remedies won??? t be considered completed until the IRS has \\nhad a reasonable time to act upon the appeal or protest.  \\n(8) Judicial Remedies:  \\nIf the IRS issues an unfavorable determination letter and all the administrative remedies were exhausted, the organization can seek judicial remedies.  For \\nexample:  -48-   a. If an organization has paid the tax resulting from the adverse \\ndetermination and met all other statutory prerequisites, it can file suit for a \\nrefund in a U.S. District Court  or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.  \\nb. If an organization elected not to pay the tax deficiency resulting from the \\nadverse determination and met all other statutory prerequisites, it can file suit for a redetermination of the tax deficiencies in the U .S. Tax Court.  \\nFor more information, see Publication 556, Examination of Returns, Appeal \\nRights, and Claims for Refund.  \\n(9) In certain situations, organizations  can file suit for a declaratory judgment in \\nthe U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, or the U.S. Tax Court. This remedy is available if an organization \\nreceived an adverse notice of final determination, or if  the IRS failed to make a \\ntimely determination on the initial or continuing qualification or classification as \\nan exempt organization.  \\n(10)  If a suit results in a final determination that an organization is exempt from \\ntax, the IRS will issue a favorable deter mination letter, provided the \\norganization has filed an application for exemption and submitted a statement that the underlying facts and applicable law are the same as in the period considered by the court.  \\n(11)  Additional Resources:  \\na. IRM 7.20.2, Determination  Letter Processing of Exempt Organizations  \\nb. Publication 557, Tax Exempt Status for Your Organization, Chapter 1, Determination Letters and Appeals Procedures . \\nA.5. Effective Date of Tax- Exemption  \\n(1) If an organization timely files its application within the required 27- month \\nperiod (see prior section IV.A.1. Section 508(a) Notice) , the effective date of \\nexemption will be the date the organization was formed. See Section IV.A. 8. \\nEntity Types and Dates of Formation,  following.  \\n(2) If an organization files its application after the required 27-month period, it may \\nbe recognized as exempt only from the date the application was filed. , unless \\nrelief is requested and granted under Treas. Reg. 301.9100- 3. Theref ore, the \\norganization will be a taxable organization for federal income tax purposes \\n(and contributions received would not be deductible) for the period before the date the application was filed.  \\nA.6. Organizations Not Required to Apply  \\n(1) Certain organizations are not required to give Sec tion 508(a) notice by filing a \\nForm 1023 (Treas. Reg. Section 1.508- 1(a)(3)):  \\na. Churches, their integrated auxiliaries, and conventions or associations of churches  -49-   b. Organizations that normally have gross receipts not in excess of $5,000, \\nand are not private f oundations  \\nc. Subordinate organizations (other than private foundations) covered by a group exemption letter  \\nd. A trust described in Section 4947(a)(1) (solely for purposes of sections 507, 508(d)(1), 508(d)(2)(A) and 508(d)(3), 508(e), 509 and chapter 42)  \\ne. Any o ther class of organization that the Commissioner from time to time \\nexcludes from the requirement of filing notice under section 508(a).  \\n(2) Organizations not required  to file notice under S ection 508(a) will be exempt \\nunder  Section 501(c)(3) if it meets the requirements of that section, whether or \\nnot it files such notice. While these organizations aren??? t required to file a Form \\n1023, they may choose to submit one to receive a determination letter \\nrecognizing exemption. A letter of determination is often necess ary for Section \\n501(c)(3) organizations to take advantage of certain benefits ( for example,  \\nstate taxes exemption, applying for grants, discounts,  and so forth ). \\n(3) The regulations provide a formula for what constitutes ??? gross receipts normally \\nnot in excess of $5,000. ??? Treas. Reg. 1.508??? 1(a)(3)(ii).  \\na. Under that  formula, the organization???s gross receipts are deemed to be \\nnormally less than $5,000 if its gross receipts don???t exceed:  \\n1. $7,500 during the first  taxable year  \\n2. $12,000 during the first two  taxable years  \\n3. $15,000 during the first three taxable years . \\nb. The regulations also provide detailed rules for the notice requirement of \\norganizations that start out within the formula but exceed the \"normally not more than $5,000 test\" in a subsequent year.  \\nA.7. Form 8940, Re quest for Miscellaneous Determination  \\n(1) Form 8940, Request for Miscellaneous Determination, is used for the following determination letter requests:  \\na. Advance approval of certain set -asides described in Section 4942(g)(2)  \\nb. Advance approval of voter registration activities described in Section \\n4945(f)     \\nc. Advance approval of scholarship procedures described in Section 4945(g)  \\nd. Exemption from Form 990 filing requirements  \\ne. Advance approval that a potential grant or contribution constitutes an ???unusual grant???  \\nf. Change in Type (or initial determination of Type) of a Section 509(a)(3) \\norganization -50-   g. Reclassification of foundation status, including a voluntary request from a \\npublic charity for private foundation status  \\nh. Termination of private foundation status under Se ction  507(b)(1)(B)  -\\nadvance ruling request  \\ni. Notice Only ??? Termination of private foundation status under Section \\n507(b)(1)(B)  \\nj. Termination of private foundation status under Section 507(b)(1)(B)  -60-\\nmonth period ended.  \\nk. Voluntary termination of  Section 501(c)(3) recognition by a government \\nentity; and  \\nl. Canadian registered charities listing on Pub. 78 Data and/or public charity \\nclassification  \\n(2) A request described above must be electronically s ubmitted on Form 8940 \\n(except where otherwise permitted, including when such request is made as \\npart of an application for recognition of exemption), along with:  \\na. All information, documentation, and other materials required by Form 8940 \\nand the instructions  \\nb. An electronic  signature signed by an authorized indiv idual under penalties \\nof perjury  \\nc. The appropriate user fee as provided in Appendix A of Rev. Proc. 2023 -5 \\n(updated annually ).  \\nd. For complete information about the filing requirements and the submission \\nprocess refer to Form 8940 and the Instructions to Form 8940.  \\nSee Rev. Proc. 2023- 12 (released in IR 2023- 70) which modifies Rev. Proc. \\n2023- 5 \\n(3) The following information refers to requests of reclassification of foundation status on Form 8940.  \\na. Initial classification of private foundation status All Section 501(c)(3) organizations are classified as private foundations \\nunder Section 509(a) unless they qualify as a public charity. The IRS \\ndetermines an organization\\'s private foundation or public charity status \\nwhen the organization files its Form 1023/1023- EZ. The foundation status \\nwill be included in the organization\\'s determination letter of tax -exempt \\nstatus.  \\nb. Requests to change from one public charity classification to another \\npublic charity classification \\nOn its Form 990, Return of Organization Exempt from  Income Tax Under \\nSection  501(c), 527, or 4947(a)(1) (except private foundations), a public \\ncharity indicates the foundation status  under which it qualifies as a public \\ncharity. Because of changes in its activities or operations, this may differ -51-   from the public charity status listed on its original determination letter. \\nAlthough an organization isn ???t required to obtain a determination letter to \\nqualify for the new public charity status, in order for IRS  records to \\nrecognize any change, an organization must obtain a new determination \\nof foundation status by filing Form 8940, pursuant to Rev. Proc. 2023 -5 \\n(updated annually).  \\nc. Requests from public charities for private foundation status If a public charity no longer qualifies under one of the paragraphs in Section  509(a)(1) -(4), then it becomes a private foundation, and it must file \\nForm 990- PF, Return of Private Foundation,  or IRC 4947(a)(1) Trust \\nTreated as Private Foundation. The organization isn ???t required to, but may, \\nobtain a determination letter on its new private foundation status. The organization indicates this change in foundation status by filing its Form 990-PF return and following any procedures specified in the form, \\ninstructions, or other published guidance. Thereafter, the organization may terminate  its private foundation status by giving notice and qualifying as a \\npublic charity again under Section  509(a)(1) -(3) during a 60- month \\ntermination period. See  Section  507(b)(1)(B) and Treas. Reg. 1.507- 2(b). \\nd. Requests from private foundations for public charity status An organization that erroneously determined it was a private foundation (for example, by incorrectly classifying an item  in its calculation of public \\nsupport) and wishes to correct the error can request a determination letter classifying it as a public charity by showing that it continuously met the public support tests during the relevant periods.  \\ne. Requests for private operating foundation status \\nA private foundation may qualify as an operating foundation under Section \\n4942(j)(3) without a deter mination letter , but the IRS won???t recognize such \\nstatus in its records without a determination letter from the IRS. An organization claiming to be an exempt operating foundation under Section  \\n4940(d)(2) must obtain a determination letter from the IR S reco gnizing \\nsuch status to be exempt from IRC 4940 tax on net investment income.  \\n(4) For complete information about filing requirements and the submission process, refer to Form 8940 and instructions.  \\n(5) See IRM 7.20.3, Processing Foundation Classification and Miscellaneous Requests . \\nA.8. Entity Types and Dates of Formation  \\n(1) Section 501(c)(3) covers only corporations, community chests, funds, and foundations. To qualify, the organization must be organized as a corporation, unincorporated association, or trust. Sole proprietorships, partnerships, individuals, or loosely associated groups of indi viduals won\\'t qualify.  \\n(2) Corporations are the most common form of organization or entity type. A corporation is an entity whose existence is evidenced by a charter or -52-   certificate of incorporation issued by the state under whose laws it was \\nincorporated.  \\na. The date of formation is the date the articles of incorporation are filed with the appropriate State  office . See Rev. Rul. 75??? 290, 1975??? 2 C.B. 215.  \\nb. See Emerson Institute v. United States, 356 F.2d 824 (D.C. Cir. 1966) for a case in which the Service successf ully challenged a claim of de facto \\ncorporate status.   \\n(3) A trust is an entity included in the terms ???fund or foundation??? and is an acceptable form of organization or entity type. See Fifth- Third Union Trust Co. \\nv. Commissioner, 56 F.2d 767 (6\\nth Cir. 1932).  \\na. The date of formation is generally the date the organizing document is \\nsigned (or otherwise adopted) by the relevant parties.  \\nb. A trust created by will isn???t considered organized before the date of the \\nfirst distribution of trust corpus to the trustee, or, if earlier, the date the decedent???s estate is considered terminated for federal tax purposes.  See \\nGCM  38529 \\n(4) Unincorporated associations  require a separate entity be formed from the \\nindividuals who created it. See Trippe v. Commissioner, 9 T.C.M. (CCH) 622 (1950) ; Morey v. Riddell, 205 F Supp. 918 (S.D. Cal. 1962).  \\na. The date of formation is generally the date the organizing document is \\nsigned (or otherwise adopted) by the relevant parties. An association???s constitution or articles of association should be s igned by at least two \\npersons . \\nb. If an unsigned copy is submitted, but there is evidence the original was signed by two or more persons, the copy will be  accept ed if accompanied \\nby a declaration signed by an a uthorized individual. The declaration must \\nattest  the copy submitted is a complete and correct copy of the original \\nand that the original was signed by at least two persons.  See Rev. Proc. \\n68-14, 1968- 1 C.B. 768.  \\nc. If the copy indicates the original wasn???t signed, submission of the declaration won???t cure the defect. In that case, the application should be \\nreturned to the applicant with a request for proof that the organizing \\ndocument has been adopted. Such a document will be acceptable only if \\nthe association can establish that it has operated in a manner clearly \\nshowing ratification by two or more persons.  \\n(5) A Limited Liability Company (LLC) is another entity type that can apply for recognition of exemption under Section 501(c)(3). In addition to completing \\nForm 1023, Notice 2021- 56, 2021- 45 I.R.B. 716, requires an LLC to submit the \\nfollowing information as part of its completed application:  \\na. Submit both the LLC\\'s state- approved articles of organization and its \\nadopted operating agreement. Both the articles of organization and the \\noperating agreement must contain the following:  -53-   b. Provisions requiring that each member of the LLC be either (i) an \\norganization described in Section 501(c)(3) and exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) or ( ii) a governmental unit described in Section \\n170(c)(1) (or wholly owned instrumentality of such a governmental unit).  \\nc. An acceptable contingency plan (such as suspension of its membership rights until a member regains recognition of its Section 501(c)(3) st atus) in \\nthe event that one or more members cease to be Section 501(c)(3) organizations or governmental units (or wholly owned instrumentalities thereof).  \\nd. Express charitable purposes and dissolution provisions in compliance with the organizational test. See lines 1 and 2 of Part III, Form 1023.  for more \\ninformation.  \\ne. The express Chapter 42 compliance provisions described in Section 508(e)(1) if the LLC is a private foundation. See Part VII, line 1a of the instructions for Form 1023 for more information on t hese provisions.  \\nNOTE:  If an LLC formed under a state LLC law that prohibits the addition \\nof provisions to articles of organization other than certain specific provisions required by the state LLC law, the provisions above may be included only in the operating agreement. An  explanation i s required if \\nprohibited from including the provisions in the articles of organization \\nunder state LLC law s. \\n(6) Submit the following representation, signed and dated by an officer, director, \\ntrustee or other governing body member (not an authorized representative):  \\n We represent that all provisions in our articles of organization and \\noperating agreement are consistent with applicable state LLC law \\nand are legally enforceable.   \\n(7) In the interpretation of an organization???s articles of organization or association, \\nState law governs the definition of the respective rights, duties, powers, and immunities of the parties. When an organization contends a term has an unusual meaning (different meaning than generally accepted) under State law, clear legal authority should be presented. See Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(b)(5).  \\n(8) If an organization???s organizing document requires only a non- substantive \\namendment to comply with the organizational test under Section 501(c)(3) (e.g., the addition of a proper dissolution clause) and the organization makes \\nthe amendment (either on its own initiative or when requested by the Service), the organization will be regarded as satisfying the organizational test from its date of formation. S ee Rev. Proc. 2022- 5, 2022- 1 I.R.B. 256 (updated \\nannually) . \\nA.9.

Annual Information Returns/Notices  \\n(1) The annual information return/notice required to be filed by an organization \\ngenerally depends on its financial activity .  \\n(2) Effective for tax years beginning after July 1, 2019, the Taxpayer First Act, Pub. L. No. 116- 25 Section 3101 amended Section 60333(n) to require \\norganizations exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) to file their annual  \\nseries Form 990 and Form 990- PF returns electronically . The Act provided \\ncertain transitional relief for small exempt organizations filing Form 990- EZ to \\nrequire electronic filing of this form for tax years ending July 31, 2021,  and \\nlater.  The following table summarizes the forms that an organization should fil e \\nand electronic filing requirements.   \\nStatus  Form to file  Electronic filing \\nrequire ment  \\nGross receipts normally ??? $50,000  \\nNote:   Organizations eligible to file the  \\ne-Postcard may choose to file a full return \\n \\n 990-N \\n (e-Postcard)  Submitted electronically, \\nthere are no paper forms .  \\nAccess through  \\nwww.irs.gov  \\nGross receipts < $200,00 0 and \\n Total assets< $500,000  990-EZ \\n-or- \\n990 Tax years ending July 31, \\n2021, and later  \\n________________  \\nTax years beginning after \\nJuly 1, 2019 \\nGross receipts ???  $200,000, or  \\nTotal assets ??? $500,000  990 Tax years beginning after \\nJuly 1, 2019 (unless \\ncovered by exceptions \\nlisted in form instructions)  \\nPrivate foundation  \\nregardless of financial status  990-PF Tax years beginning after \\nJuly 1, 2019 (unless \\ncovered by exceptions \\nlisted in form instructions)  \\n(3) The information return s and notice are due on the 15th day of the 5th month \\nafter the end of the organization\\'s fiscal year.  \\n(4) The due date may be extended for six months, without showing cause, by filing Form 8868, Application for Automatic Extension of Time to  File an \\nExempt Organization Return, before the due date. An organization will only be allowed an extension of 6 months for a return for a tax year.  \\n(5) The IRS rejects electronically filed returns that are materially incomplete or the \\nwrong return.  -57-   (6) If an organization doesn??? t file a required r eturn or files late, the IRS may \\nassess penalties. Note: There is no penalty assessment for filing Form 990- N \\nlate. See IRM 4.75.22.5.2.1, Penalties to  Be Assessed.  \\nB.2. Automatic Revocation  \\n(1) Organizations that fail to file required Forms 990, 990- PF, 990-EZ or 990- N for \\nthree consecutive years will automatically lose their tax -exempt status. See \\nSection 6033(j)(1)(B).  \\n(2) The IRS is required to notify an organization after the organization has failed \\nto file for two consecutive years. This notice is to meet the legi slative mandate \\nunder Section 3102 of the Taxpayer First Act (Public Law 116- 25). See \\nSection 6033(j)(1)(A).  \\n(3) The IRS issues Notice CP 120C, Second Failure to File an Annual Return or \\nNotice, to organizations as a reminder  to avoid failing to file for the third \\nconsecutive year.   \\n(4) Revocation of the organization\\'s tax -exempt status will occur  on the filing due \\ndate of the third consecutively  missed year.   \\n(5) The IRS issues Notice CP 120A, Revocation Notice for Failure to File an Annual Information Return, to revoked organizations.  \\n(6) Automatically revoked organizations are updated on the Exempt Organizations  \\nBusiness Master File ( EOBMF) to Status 97 on the Integrated Data Retrieval \\nSystem (IDRS).  \\n(7) The IRS publishes and maintains a list of revoked organizations.  The on- line \\nsearch tool, Tax Exempt Organization Search (TEOS), will show revocation information for organizations revoked. See section VI. A. Tax Exempt Organizations Search following.  \\nB.3. Reinstatement After Automatic Revocation  \\n(1) Organizations whose tax -exempt status was automatically revoked because \\nthey didn???t file required Form 990 series returns or notices for three consecutiv e years can apply for reinstatement of their tax -exempt status.  \\n(2) The following four procedures can be used by an organization to apply for reinstatement:  \\na. Streamlined Retroactive Reinstatement  \\nOrganizations that were eligible to file Form 990- EZ or 990- N (e-Postcard) \\nfor the three years that caused their revocation may have their tax -exempt \\nstatus retroactively reinstated to the date of revocation if they:  \\n??? Haven???t previously had their tax -exempt status automatically \\nrevoked \\n??? Complete and submit Form 1023, Form  1023- EZ with the \\nappropriate user fee not later than 15 months after the later of the date of the organization???s Revocation Letter (CP -120A) or the date -58-   the organization appeared on the Revocation List on the IRS \\nwebsite.   \\nb. Retroactive Reinstatement Process  (within 15 months)  \\nOrganizations that can???t use the Streamlined Retroactive Reinstatement Process (such as those that were required to file Form 990 or Form 990-PF for any of the three years that caused revocation or those that were previously auto- revok ed) may have their tax -exempt status retroactively \\nreinstated to the date of revocation if they:  \\n??? Complete and submit Form 1023, Form 1023- EZ with the \\nappropriate user fee not later than 15 months after the later of the date on the organization???s revocation letter (CP -120A) or the date \\nthe organization appeared on the Revocation List on the IRS website.  \\n??? Include with the application a statement establishing that the \\norganization had reasonable cause for its failure to file a required \\nannual return for at leas t one of the three consecutive years in \\nwhich it failed to file.  \\n??? Include with the application a statement confirming that it has filed required returns for those three years and for any other taxable years after such period and before the post -mark date of  the \\napplication for which required returns were due and not filed.  \\n??? File properly completed and executed paper annual returns for the three consecutive years that caused the revocation and any \\nfollowing years.  \\nc. Retroactive Reinstatement (after 15 months)  \\nOrganizations that apply for reinstatement more than 15 months after the \\nlater of the date on the organization???s revocation letter (CP -120A) or the \\ndate the organization appeared on the Revocation List on the IRS website may have their tax -exempt status ret roactively reinstated to the date of \\nrevocation if they:  \\n??? Satisfy all of the requirements described under the Retroactive \\nReinstatement (within 15 months) procedure.  \\n??? Provide a reasonable cause statement establishing reasonable \\ncause for its failure to file a required annual return or notice for all \\nthree consecutive years in which it failed to file.  \\nd. Post -mark date reinstatement  \\nOrganizations may apply for reinstatement effective from the post -mark \\ndate of their applic ation if they:  \\n??? Complete and submit the appropriate application  \\n??? Pay the applicable user fee  \\nSee Revenue Procedure 2014- 11, 2014- 3 I.R.B. 411.  -59-   B.4. Employment Tax Obligations  \\n(1) All Section 501(c)(3) organizations  that pay wages to employees must \\nwithhold, deposit and pay employment tax, including federal income tax \\nwithholding and Social Security and Medicare (FICA) taxes.  \\n(2) An organization should have a Form W -4, Employee???s Withholding Allowance \\nCertificate, on fi le for each employee.  \\n(3) Employment taxes are reported on Form 941, Employer???s Quarterly Federal Tax Return.  \\n(4) If the IRS has instructed a small employer (one who has withheld employment taxes of $1,000 or less during the year) to file Form 944, Employer???s Annual Federal Tax Return, instead of Form 941, the employer must do so. The employer must file Form 944 even if there is no tax due or if the taxes exceed $1,000 unless the IRS tells it to file Form 941 (or it is filing a final return). The instructions to Form 944 provide information on how to have the filing \\nrequirement changed from Form 944 to Form 941.  \\n(5) Any person who fails to withhold and pay employment tax may be subject to penalties. See IRM 4.23.9, Employment Tax Penalty, Fraud, and Identity Theft \\nProcedures.  \\n(6) Generally , Section 501(c)(3) organizations aren\\'t subject to FUTA tax. \\nHowever, a S ection 501(c)(3) organization is subject to FUTA tax when paying \\nwages to employees on behalf of a N on-Section 501(c)(3) organization.  See \\nSection 3306(c)(8).  \\n(7) Exampl es include:  \\na. A Section 501(c)(3) organization paying wages to employees of a related \\nNon-Section 501(c)(3) organization \\nb. A Section 501(c)(3) organization.  that is a S ection 3504 agent paying \\nwages on behalf of a N on-Section 501(c)(3) organization  \\nc. A Section 5 01(c)(3) organization that is a common paymaster paying \\nwages on behalf of a N on-Section 501(c)(3) organization .  \\n(8) Payments to independent contractors  don???t generally require tax -exempt \\norganizations to withhold or pay employment taxes , but they may have \\ninformation reporting requirements  (Form 1099- Misc) .  \\n(9) If a charity incorrectly classifies an employee as an independent contractor, it may be held liable for employment taxes for that worker.  See IRM 4.23.5, \\nTechnical Guidelines for Employment Tax Issues; and IRM 4.23.6, Classification Settlement Program (CSP).  \\n(10) The requirements for withholding, depositing, reporting and paying employment taxes are explained in Publication 15, (Circular E), Employer???s Tax Guide. For help in determining if workers are employees  or independent \\ncontractors, see Publication 15- A, Employer???s Supplemental Tax Guide. -60-   Publication 557 provides information about tax -exempt status and covers the \\nemployment tax responsibilities of exempt organizations.  \\n(11) Although churches are excepted from filing Form 990, they do have \\nemployment tax responsibilities. Employees of churches or church- controlled \\norganizations are subject to income tax withholding but may be exempt from FICA taxes. Like other 501(c)(3) organizations, churches are not required to pay FUTA tax. In addition, although ministers generally are common -law \\nemployees, they aren??? t treated as employees for employment tax purposes. \\nThese special employment tax rules for members of the clergy and religious workers are explained  in Publication 517, Social Security and Other \\nInformation for Members of the Clergy and Religious Workers. Churches should also consult Publications 15 and 15- A and Publication 1828, Tax Guide \\nfor Churches and Religious Organizations.  \\nB.5. Other Forms and Retu rns \\n(1) An exempt organization may be required to file other forms or notices depending on its activities.  \\n(2) Some commonly filed forms by tax -exempt organizations include:  \\na.

Public Inspection  \\n(1) An exempt organization mus t make available for public inspection its \\napplication for tax -exempt status. An application for tax exemption includes the \\napplication form, all documents  and statements the IRS requires the \\norganization to file with the form, any statement or other suppor ting document \\nsubmitted by an organization in support of its application, and any letter or other document issued by the IRS concerning the application.  A reasonable \\nfee for copying and mailing costs may be charged. See Section 6104(d)(1).  \\n(2) IRC 6110 requires the IRS to make redacted versions of its written determinations  publicly available, including : -62-   a. Determination letters  \\nb. Private letter rulings  \\nc. Technical advice memoranda and  \\nd. Chief Counsel advice  \\n(3) Publication 557 provides details of  public inspection requirements for \\nexemption applications, certain material required to be withheld from public \\ninspection, an exempt organization???s obligation to furnish copies to anyone who requests documents, annual information returns and political organization reporting forms .  \\n(4) See IRM 7.28.4., Public Inspection of Written Determinations Under IRC 6110.  \\nV. Examination Techniques  \\n(1) Section  501(c)(3) requires an organization to be both ???organized??? and ???operated??? \\nexclusively for one or more Section  501(c)(3) purposes. If the organizat ion fails \\neither the organizational test or the operational test, it isn???t exempt . See Treas. \\nReg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(a)(1).  \\nA. Primary Objectives of an Examination  \\n(1) The primary objectives for the examination of an exempt organization are to determine if :  \\na. The organization is organized and operated in accordance with its exempt purpose(s), thus continuing to be recognized as exempt from federal income taxes.  \\nb. The Form 990, Form 990- EZ, Form 990- PF, or Form 5227 is complete, \\ncorrect, and contains all public information required by Section  6033.  \\nc. The exempt organization has properly filed all returns and forms for which it???s liable.  \\nd. The exempt organization or its related entities are liable for other taxes and if so, the correct amount of tax.  \\n(2) The core of every exempt organization examination is to examine the following:  \\na. Organizational documents  \\nb. Activities  \\nc. Financial transactions  \\n(3) Section 7602 gives examiners the authority to:  \\na. Examine any books, papers, records or other data necessary to complete an examination.  \\nb. Take testimony under oath to secure additional needed information.  \\nc. Issue summons for information necessary to complete an examination.  -63-   d. Ask about any offense connected to the administering or enforcing of the \\nInternal Revenue laws.  \\n(4) Examination procedures are contained in IRM 4.75, Exempt Organization???s Examination Procedures .  \\n(5) See IRM 4.75.16.1.6 f or a comprehensive list of relevant forms and publications \\nan examiner may need to close an examined or non- examined case,  \\nB. Conducting the  Organizational Test \\n(1) The organizational test applies to the organization???s articles of organization or comparable governing document.  \\n(2) Secure and review all organizational documents (original creating document and all subsequent amendments).  \\n(3) Compare the or ganizational documents and organizational purposes with \\nSection 501(c)(3) provision requirements  to ensure that the organizational    \\ndocuments and the organization???s exempt purposes are consistent with Section \\n501(c)(3).   \\n(4) Confirm  the organizing document:  \\na. Includes an acceptable purpose clause  \\nb. Includes a dissolution clause ( in most cases )  \\nc. Includes a powers clause which is not too broad.   \\nd. See prior section II. Exemption Requirements, B. Organizational Test,  for \\nspecifics.   \\n(5) If an organization fails the organizational test, discuss the issue with your group manager. The manager, agent, and Area Counsel, if necessary, will discuss possible remedies.  \\n(6) See IRM 4.75.11.8.1, Governing Instruments, for guidance on procedures regardi ng an organization???s governing instrument.    \\nC. Conducting the Operational Test  \\n(1) The operational test applies to the organization???s activities and how they  further \\nexempt purposes.  \\n(2) Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(c)(1) provides that an organization will be regarded \\nas ???operated exclusively??? for one or more exempt purposes if it engages primarily in activities which accomplish one or more of such exempt purposes specified in S ection 501(c)(3). It further provides that an organization will not be \\nso regarded if more t han an insubstantial part of its activities isn??? t in furtherance \\nof an exempt purpose.  \\n(3) There???s no legal definition in the IRC for commonly used terms such as ???exclusively,??? ???primarily,??? ???substantial??? and ???insubstantial??? which are found throughout the IRC and regulations. For purposes of the operational test, these -64-   terms apply to the review of the purposes, activities, time and resources of \\nexempt organizations to determine if they are operating for Section 501(c)(3) purposes. There is no express formula or measurement in the IRC for the operational test. Rather, all  facts and circumstances pertaining to the \\noperational test should be considered when making these determinations.  \\nOften, exemption is determined on the basis of  stated purposes and proposed \\nactivities.  \\n(4) Test and measure the activities and operations to determine if the organization is operating primarily in furtherance of the purpose(s) for which it was granted exempt status.  \\n(5) Examine the sources of income, application of funds, assets and liabilit ies, to \\nthe extent necessary to e nsure that the financial transactions are consistent \\nwith the exempt purpose activities of the organization.  \\n(6) For more information s ee section II. Exemption Requirements, C. Operational \\nTest of this TG.  \\nC.1. Examiner Responsibilities   \\n(1) IRM 4.75.10, Exempt Organization Pre- contact Procedures, focuses on \\nprocedures to be performed prior to the initial contact and visitation for a field examination and/or as part of the initial steps in an office correspondence examination.  \\n(2) See IRM 4.75.11, On- Site Audit Guidelines, for exam procedures and guidance \\nincluding:  \\na.

IRM 4.75.11.17, Other Audit Considerations    \\n(3) Examiners and managers are also responsible for being familiar with and acting \\nin accordance with taxpay er rights. See Section  7803(a)(3).  -65-   C.2. Reviewing and Analyzing  Activities and Financial Records  \\n(1) A Section 501(c)(3)  organization???s operations must be reviewed and analyzed \\nto determine if it???s operating in a manner consistent with its exempt purpose.  \\n(2) The organization???s  purposes, activities and financial transactions are the items  \\nreviewed and analyzed. Consider  the length of time the activity is conducted, \\nthe number and type of employees and volunteers used to conduct each \\nactivity, the assets used to conduct the activity, the liabilities and expenses incurred in conducting each activity, and the revenue generated or not generated by each activity.  \\n(3) Group activities into categories , such as , \\na. Related  \\nb. Unrelated,  \\nc. Permissible , and  \\nd. Prohibited.  \\n(4) Analyze  an activity to determine whether it is an exclusive activity, a primary \\nactivity, a substantial activity, an insubstantial activity or a de minimis activity.  \\n(5) Allocate the financial transactions, assets and liabilities to each activity on the \\nbasis of time, space, use, personnel, or any other reasonable method in order to determine the size and extent of an organization???s activities.  \\nC.3. Issue Development and Conclusion  \\n(1) An examiner???s responsibilities in developing and concluding issues present in an examination include:  \\na. Fact development  \\nb. Rules of evidence  \\nc. Special procedures for specific issues  \\nd. Concluding an issue \\ne. Research of tax law.  \\n(2) See IRM 4.75.13, Issue Development and Conclusion , for guidance.  \\nD. Additional Examination Requirements  \\n(1) During an exam, examiners are responsible for determining if an organization:  \\na. Continues to meet its requirements for exemption and retains its tax -\\nexempt status  \\nb. Filed all required tax and information returns  \\nc. Merits waiving certain filing checks for certain returns  \\nd. Reported information and its tax liability correctly.   \\n(2) All examinations require the conduct of a filing check, which involves:  -66-   a. Reviewing the filing of other returns to determine whether the taxpayer is \\nin compliance with all filing requirements  \\nb. Determin ing whether the taxpayer is liable for other federal taxes, \\npotentially leading to referrals  \\nc. Securing delinquent  returns  \\nd. Expansion of the exam  if warranted . \\n(3) Although by itself not an actual examination, a package audit is a series of additional steps beyond a filing check, generally used in the pre- contact stage \\nof the examination to evaluate completion and accuracy of a filed return. In a package audit process, the examiner reconciles and analyzes inconsistencies between filed returns or between returns and other doc uments available prior to \\nreviewing books and records.  \\n(4) See IRM 4.75.12, Exempt Organizations Examination Procedures, Required Filing checks and Package Audit Procedures , for guidance.  \\nD.1.

Can involve a comparison between any type of return, not just employment tax returns.  \\ng. The conclusion of a package audit is useful in:  \\nh. Identifying additional issues  \\ni. Deciding to expand the scope of the examination  \\nj. Revising examination steps and techniques.  \\n(2) See IRM 4.75.12.5, Package Audit Guidelines  for guidance.  \\nVI. Other Resources \\nA.

The table below provides instructions  on these special rules \\nfor registration.  \\nTable 8  ??? Special rules for registration  \\nEntity/Scenario  Instructions  \\nLead  FI and Member FIs of \\nan (EAG)  In general, all FFIs, other than exempt beneficial owners or certified deemed -compliant FFIs that are \\npart of the same (EAG)  must be registered. For purposes of registration, an (EAG)  may have more \\nthan one lead  FI and may organize itself for purposes of r egistration into subgroups under different \\nlead FIs. For example, an (EAG) of 10 FFIs may decide to select two different lead  FIs, lead FI 1 and \\nlead FI 2. L ead FI 1 can carry out FATCA r egistr ation on behalf of four of its m ember FIs and lead \\nFI 2 can car ry out FATCA r egistration on behalf of four of its other m ember FIs. All 10 FFIs within \\nthe same (EAG)  will be registered, even though they are regis tered under two different lead FIs. \\nConsolidated Compliance \\nProgram  If an (EAG)  has in place a consolidated compliance program, as described in Treas. R eg. ??1.1471 -4 \\n(f )(2)(ii), then m ember FIs that elect to participate in the same consolidated complianc e program \\nshould be registered as m ember FIs by the lead  FI that is acting as th e complia nce FI for the \\ncompliance group . \\nReporting FI under a \\nModel 1 IGA  FIs that are treated as r eporting FIs under a Model 1 IGA (see the list of jurisdictions treated as \\nhaving in effect an IGA at FATCA Archive ) should register as  Reporting Financial Institution under \\na Model 1 IGA.  A disregarded entity in a Model 1 IGA jurisdiction must register as an entity \\nseparate from its owne r in order to be treated as a reporting FI under a Model 1 IGA, provided that \\nthe disregarded entity is treated as a separate entity for purposes of its reporting to the applica ble \\nModel 1 jurisdiction . \\nReporting FI under a \\nModel 2 IGA  FIs that are treated as r eporting FIs under a Model 2 IGA (see the list of jurisdictions treated as \\nhaving in effect an IGA at FATCA Archive ) should register as Participating FFI including a \\nReporting Financial Institution under a Model 2 IGA . \\nFFIs and direct reporting \\nNFFE s that are also \\nSponsoring Entities  An FFI or direct repo rting NFFE  that will also act as a sponsoring entity  for one or more sponsored  \\nentities  is required to submit a second registration form to act as a sponsoring entity. The sponsoring \\nentity  will receive a separate GIIN and should only use that GIIN when it  is fulfilling its obligations \\nas a sponsoring entit y. \\nTrustees of Trustee -\\nDocumented Trusts  A trustee of a trustee -documented t rust is generally required to submit a registration form to obtain a \\nGIIN and should only use that GIIN when fulfilling its  obligations as a trustee of a t ruste e-\\ndocumented t rust. In addition, a trustee that is an FFI may need to submit a second registration form \\nfor use in reporting its own accounts . \\nSponsored Entities  A sponsored  FFI and sponsored  direct reporting NFFE  must be registered by its sponsoring entity  \\nthroug h the FATCA Registration website.  Separate GIINs will be issued to each approved \\nsponsored entity  and published on the IRS FFI l ist. Sponsored entities  cannot log into the  online  \\nregistration system and will recei ve their GIINs from their sponsoring entity . \\nUSFIs treated as Lead FIs A USFI registering as the lead FI on behalf of its m ember FIs will register as a lead FI and receive a \\nGIIN . \\nBranch es In general, a branch must be registered as a branch of its owner and not as a separate entity.  \\nHowever, see r eporting FI under a Model 1 IGA, for a special rule for branches that are disregarded \\nentiti es in Model 1 IGA jurisdictions . \\n \\n   \\n                                                                                                                                             \\n15 \\n3 FATCA Online Registration System : User Login  \\n3.1  Launching the FATCA Online Registration System  \\nThe FATCA Online Registration System can be accessed from  the IRS.gov FATCA Registration Landing page . Click the \\n???register or l ogin??? button. Always remembe r to click the ??? logout ??? link when finished with a session or close the browser. \\nClosing a tab when multiple tabs are open, does not immediately end your session until the system closes it due to 15 \\nminutes of inactivity.  \\n \\n3.2  Create a New Account ??? Single, Lead, and Sponsoring Entity  \\nThe first step in the FATCA registration process is to create an online FATCA account. Only a single, lead, or sponsoring \\nentity will be able to create a FATCA account. Member FIs will have their FATCA accounts created by their lead FI and will \\nreceive their  FATCA IDs and temporary access codes from their lead FI, to login as an existing user to complete their online \\nregistration. See Registration Process Overview  for definitions of the different FI types . \\n \\nTo create an account, the user will be required to select and answer  challenge questions and create an access code (password). \\nAfter the single, lead, or sponsoring entity creates its account, it will be issued  a FATCA ID. The FATCA ID is used to \\nidentify the FI or direct r eporting NFFE  only for purposes of registration and is not the same number as the GIIN. A GIIN \\nis issued after the FATCA registration is submitted and approved.  \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 3 ??? Create new FATCA  account for single FI, lead FI, or sponsoring e ntity  \\n \\n1. Select the checkbox that states, ???By checking this box, I declare that I have been authorized by the FI to create a \\nregistration account on their behalf.??? Direct reporting NFFEs should  select  the check box if they have been authorized \\nby the direct r eporting NFFE to create a FATCA r egistration account on their behalf.  \\n2. Click the ???create account??? button.  \\nNOTE : If you have entered data in the FATCA ID and access code  fields before you selected the checkbox, the two fields \\nwill be cleared,  and the ??? login??? button will be disabled. \\n \\n                                                                                                                                             \\n16 \\n3.

Although the FATCA Registration System navigation \\nbar displays ???Part 3???, Part 3 is no longer a part of the  system .  \\nThe following chapter describes how to answer the questions  within each part of the registration .  \\nFor each registration question , this user guide provides up to two informational sections which help users to answer the \\nquestion. The two sections are : \\n??? Instructions  ??? available for all questions to help the user to answer  the question and navigate the  registration  \\nsystem .  \\n??? Additional Guidance (if applicable) ??? available for questions where additional detail  is necessary to help the user  \\nto answer the question. \\n \\nBe sure to read all text provided before answering the  question. Direct r eporting NFFEs should follow the instructions \\napplicable to FIs, except where other wise indicated . \\n4.1  Registration Part 1  \\nBefore you begin, see Chapter 2.3 I nformation You Need to Register  for the information you need to complete the \\nregistration.  \\nAfter logging into the system, the registration process will begin with Part 1. Part 1 consists of 11 questions that request \\nidentifying information about the FI or direct r eporting NFFE  and must be completed by all FI types. A lead FI can complete \\nPart 1 for its member FI(s), but the member  will typically complete Part 1 for itself. The following section provides step-by-\\nstep guidance for answering the questions in Part 1. See Appendix E  for Registration field format.  \\n1. Access Part 1 of the online registration:  \\n \\n??? First-time login: After you have created an account and the system displays the FATCFIFI-\\nsingle/lead/sponsoring entity account confirmation page (as shown in Chapter 3.1 Launching the FATCA \\nRegistration System), click the ???next??? button. \\n??? Existing users: On your home page (as shown in Ch apter 5 H ome Page and Account Options), under Available \\nAccount Options, select  the registration  edit link available  to you. The link available  is based on your FI type \\nand status.  \\n \\nNOTE : If a user does not log out of the system using the ???logout??? link, the system does not log the user out immediately. \\nThis can occur if the user closes the browser or gets an error message that forces them out of the system. If the user tries to \\nlog back in immediately, a default error message will display  indicating that the FATCA account is locked because it is being \\nedited by another user. The system times out after 15 minutes of inactivity, so after 15 minutes, the original session that was \\nexited will time out and the user will be able to log in again.   \\n                                                                                                                                             \\n23 \\n \\nFigure 14 ???

Registration Part 4 ???  Submit registration (Par t 4) ???  Submission confirmation/next Steps  \\nAdditional Guidance:  \\nFor purposes of Part 4, the term RO means  the individual with authority under local law to submit the information provided \\non behalf of the FI. In the case of FIs or FI branches not governed by a Model 1 IGA, this individual must also have authority \\nunder local law to certify that the FI meets the requirements applicable to the FI status or statuses identified in the registration. \\nThe individual must be able to certify, to the best of his or her  knowledge that the information provided in the FIs or direct \\nreporting NFFE???s registration is accurate and complete.  \\nIn the case of an FI, the individual must be able to certify that the FI meets the requirements applicable to the status(es) \\nidentified i n the FIs  registration.  However, a reporting  FI under a Model 1 IGA that has branches (as identified in Part 1, \\nQuestion 9) that are located outside of a Model 1 IGA jurisdiction will also agree to the terms applicable to the statuses of such \\nbranches.   \\n In the case of direct reporting NFFE , the individual must be able to certify that the direct reporting NFFE  meets the \\nrequirements of a direct  reporting NFFE  under Treas. Reg. ??1.1472- 1(c)(3).  \\n An RO (as defined for purposes of Part 4) can delegate authori zation to complete Part 4 by signing a Form 2848,  Power of \\nAttorney Form and Declaration of Representative , or other similar form or document (including an applicable form or \\ndocument under local law giving the agent the authorization to provide the inform ation required for the FATCA Registration).  \\n \\nBy signing the registration form, the individual certifies that, to the best of his or her knowledge, the information submitted \\nabove is accurate and complete and that the individual is authorized to agree that  the FI or direct reporting NFFE  intends to \\ncompl y with its FATCA obligations.  The RO identified in Part 4 need not be the same individual identified as the RO in \\nQuestion 10 or Question 11B. \\nA reporting FI under a Model 1 or Model 2 IGA ope rating one or m ore branches not in an IGA jurisdiction is also agreeing \\nto the te rms of an FFI Agreement for any such branch. \\n   \\n                                                                                                                                             \\n43 \\n5 Home Page and Account Options  \\nAfter creating an  account, the home page provides a central location for accessing account summary information and \\nmaking changes to the account.

An FI will use the GIIN to identify itself to withholding agents for \\npurposes of chapter 4 of  the FATCA regulations a nd to identify itself as the reporting institution for information reporting \\npurposes under FATCA. For more information on the composition of the global intermediary identification number , see the \\nFATCA Online Registration System and FFI List GIIN Composition Information page  on IRS.gov.  \\n \\nWhen an Approved FI updates th e count ry/jurisdiction of residence for tax purposes in Registration, the system will update the \\nGIIN when the registration is reprocessed (typically within a few days) and can be viewed on the home page.  The updated \\ncountry/jurisdiction and GIIN will not  displa y on the FFI list until the next publication of the list.  \\nIf you are registered as a single, lead or member type FI and are also a sponsoring entity, each FI type account  has a unique \\nand separate GIIN . \\n \\nEffective Date -  \\n \\nIf the FI is in approved status, an effective date will be displayed. In general, the term ???Effective Date of the FI agreement??? \\nmeans the date on which the IRS issues an initial GIIN to the FI.  \\n \\nIf the FI changes its FI type or transfers to an (EAG) , the effective date remains the same d ate on which the IRS issued the \\ninitial GIIN to the FI.  \\n \\nFor FIs that received a GIIN on or before June 30, 2014, the effective date of the FI agreement is June 30, 2014. \\n \\n5.2  Renewal of FFI Agreement \\nCertain FIs and their branches must periodically renew t heir FFI agreement by verifying and updating their \\ninformation. The IRS will notify all approved FIs via email and message board when a required renewal period begins. The \\nIRS will also send a reminder message prior to the due date.  \\n \\nFIs notified of the potential need to renew their agreement should login to the FATCA Online Registration System and view the ???Renewal of FFI Agreement??? page by selecting the Renew FFI Agreement  link under Available Accou nt Options on \\nthe home page. After viewing the page, FIs  must determine if they need to renew their agreement and then must submit \\ntheir determination. FIs renewing their agreement will maintain the same FATCA ID and GIIN. Lead FIs cannot renew on behalf o f a member FI.  2  \\n                                                                                                                                             \\n45 \\n \\nFigure 34 ??? Renewal of FFI agreement process  \\n \\nThe system???s home page, during the renewal open period, will have a Renew FFI Agreement link for FIs in approved  \\nstatus. All FIs should follow steps 1 through 4 below to determine if they must renew their agreement. FIs required to renew \\nshould complete steps 5 through 7. They should also verify and update responses to all registration answers provided during \\nthe most recent  registration.  \\nFIs required to renew their agreement and fail to r enew , will have their re gistration f lagged as overdue.  I f an FIs  renewal \\nremains overdue, the FI???s registration may be taken out of approved status . In that case, the FI will not appear on the \\npublished IRS FFI List. The IRS FFI List is updated monthly to add or remove approved FIs (or thei r branches) or direct \\nreporting NFFEs. For more information, please visit the FATCA FFI List landing page . \\nNOTE : Please check the FAQ  page for additional information regarding renewal status and general renewal information.  \\nAfter the renewal period ends, the FFI agreement renewal information will remain on the home page, but the link for renewal \\nof agreement will  no longer display.

For single, lead , and member FIs, \\nall approved branches if applicable , are included in the FIs certification.  \\nAfter an FIs registration status is approved, the FI will be notified via email an d message board message that COPA is \\navailable for completion. Once the message is received, the FI can complete  and submit the COPA and has until July 1st of \\nthe calendar year following the end of the certification period ( three ful l calendar years after approval) to submit the \\ncertification.

The certification period determined by the system is based on the effective date of the FFI agreement or the date a G IIN \\nwas issued for entities that do not enter into an FFI agreement (e.g. Dir ect Reporting NFFEs).  This is referred to as \\nthe ???effective date??? for purposes of this user guide.  \\n \\n??? Select ???yes??? to continue with the suggested certification type and certificati on period.  \\n??? Select ???no??? to select a different certification type or to change the certification period. Then select a different \\ncertification type or certification period. The certification period???s start date cannot be earlier than the FIs \\neffective date.   \\n  \\n                                                                                                                                             \\n55 \\nNOTE :  If the modified period does not cover the entire certification period, after submitting the certification, you \\nwill be asked if you want to submit an additional certification.  \\n \\nSystem Determines Certification is Not Required   \\nIf the system determines the FI is not required to submit a periodic certification for the certifi cation period, you can \\nstill submit a certification.  \\n \\n??? Select ???yes??? to submit a certification. Select a certification type from the options available in the drop -down \\nlist. If you want to change the dates, the certification period start date cannot be  earlier than the FIs effective \\ndate. The certification period end date cannot be later than the certification period???s end date.  \\n??? Select ???no??? if you agree that you are not requir ed to submit a periodic certification.

The system will update the periodic certification status to ???Not Required???.  \\nNOTE : For FIs not required to submit a periodic certification, the process ends here if you c hoose not to submit a \\ncertification  \\nInstructions page - Read the instructions for th e periodic certification . This explains the sections you will be completing.  \\nBe aware, if you exit the certification after the instructions page or further, when you return, the process will restart at the \\ninstructions page and you are unable to change your classification from the certification link.  \\n \\n4. Identifying Information ???  Confirm the responsible officer (RO) information and make updates as needed. Any \\nupdates made will be saved to your registration account.

If the trustee had any trustee documented trusts that \\nwere subject to a Model 2 IGA, select ???yes??? and add the legal name of each trustee -documented \\ntrust to be included in the certification as well as the country/jurisdiction (maximum 1000 \\ntrusts).   \\nFor subsequent certifications, the system will display the list of trustee -documented trusts that \\nwere included in the previous certification.  If the trustee did not have any of trustee -\\ndocumented trusts that were subject to a Mode l 2 IGA, select ???No??? and the certification status \\nwill be updated to s ubmitted.  \\nb. For a Sponsoring entity of sp onsored FFIs and s ponsored dir ect reporting NFFEs, RO must  \\ncomplete both the sponsored FFIs certification and the sponsored direct reporting NFFEs before \\nbeing able to submit the periodic certification.  The certification status wi ll not be changed to \\nsubmitted  until both parts are com pleted and the FI ???clicks??? the submit button on the summary \\npage . \\n \\n5. Options for Certification -  This section includes options  for the FI to indicate  whether  it is complet ing the periodic \\ncertification, is unable to complete the periodic certification, or doesn???t have  to complete periodic certification .

All eligible entities will be displayed.  There may be multiple pages of \\nmembers/sponsored entities. The user may select all eligible entities by checking the box above the table or select \\nall the entities on a single page by checking the top box on the table.  \\n \\nIf a per iodic c ertification has been submitted by or for a member, the most recent submission date appears in the \\nlast column (Last P eriodic Certification).

Sponsored di rect reporting NFFE (for Sp onsoring Entity of Sponsored Direct Reporting \\nNFFEs  certification  type only)  \\n \\nIf you do not select all sponsored entities , you must  state the reason why.  \\n \\nIf there are no eligible sponsored entities, the sponsoring entity may  still complete the certification.  \\n \\n7. Periodic certification question sets  - Complete the certification questions. If applicable, you may be required to \\nanswer initial questions to direct y ou to the appropriate question set for Qualified Certification or Certification of \\nEffective Internal Controls. If the answers to the questions do not match the responses to the initial questions, an \\nerror message will appear when saving or submitting. Be prepared to provide explanations and descriptions to \\nsupport your answers. The number of questions is dependent on the certification type. You c an view the sets of \\nquestions on the  FATCA Certifications webpage.  \\n8. Submit the certification  ??? Once you have completed all questions, click ???Submit??? at the bottom of the page.  When \\nprompted for the submit certification warning, acknowledge that you want to submit the certification by clicking \\n???yes.??? The periodic certification submitted page confir ms you have submitted the certification and provides your \\ncertification result (based on the responses provided). Click ???OK??? to return to the home page. The periodic \\ncertification status will be updated to Submitted and a message board message confirms sub mission and the \\ncertification results. If you submitted a certification that does not cover the entire certification period, you will be \\nasked if you want to submit an additional certific ation. View your certification history table for a list of all submit ted \\ncertifications.  \\n   \\n                                                                                                                                             \\n58 \\nTable 19 -- Periodic Certification Results  \\nPeriodic Certification \\nResult  Description  \\nNot Required  This result will be displayed when a Respo nsible Officer selects the option indicating that it is \\n???not required to complete a periodic certification for this certification period???.   When this \\noption is selected, the user will be required to provide a brief explanation.  The IRS may follow \\nup with  additional inquiries based on the explanation provided.  \\n  \\nNOTE:  There is no exemption or waiver from the certification requirement when one is \\nrequired to be submitted. It is expected that those indicating they are not required to complete a \\nperiodic cer tification for the certification period do so in very specific and limited \\ncircumstances.  \\n \\nWith respect to the periodic certification for Trustee -Documented Trusts, this will be the result \\nif the Trustee of a Trustee- Documented Trust indicates that it did not have any Trustee -\\nDocumented Trusts that are subject to a Model 2 IGA during the certification period.  \\nCompliance  This result will be displayed when a Responsible Officer completes the periodic certification \\nand the responses provided as part of the ce rtification do not indicate any material failure that \\nhas not been corrected prior to the date of the certification; o r a failure by a Registered \\nDeemed -Compliant FFI or Trustee -Documented Trust to comply with any of the requirements \\nwith respect to their FATCA classification.  \\nQualified Certification  This result will be displayed when the RO of a PFFI, Compliance FI, or  Sponsoring Entity \\nindicates that there were events of default during the certification period and/or there were \\nmaterial failures during the certification period that were not corrected prior to the certification \\ndate, but that the FI indicates that it will take corrective actions to remediate the failure.  \\n \\nAn overall result of ???Qualified Certification??? indicates that the FI did fail to co mply with one \\n(or more) of its requirement but that is working on correcting such failure(s).  \\nFailure to Certify  This result will be displayed when a Responsible Officer selects the option indicating that it is \\n???unable to complete a periodic certification  at this time???.  \\n \\nThis will also be the result if the responses provided as part of the certification indicate any \\nmaterial failures or events of default for which the FI indicates that it will not take any \\ncorrective actions to remediate the failure or ev ent of default; or  a failure by a Registered \\nDeemed -Compliant FFI or Trustee -Documented Trust to comply with any of the requirements \\nwith respect to their FATCA classification.   \\nAn overall result of ???Failure to Certify??? will result in an event of default that could cause \\ntermination of the entity???s FATCA status.   \\n \\nSubmitting an additional certification  \\nYou cannot edit a periodic certification once you submit it. Instead, you must submit an additional periodic certification to  \\ninclude updated information. Generally, submitting an additional periodic certification will supersede the previously \\nsubmitted periodic certification. However, all submitted certifications are saved in the registration system. You can view a \\nhistory of submitted periodic certificati ons from the certification history link on the home page.  \\n  \\n                                                                                                                                             \\n59 \\n5.6 Available Account Options  \\nAn FI can access links to manage its account via the Available Account Options section of the home page.

XML File Preparation Instructions for Adding Multiple Sponsored Entities \\nusing a File Upload  \\nThe XML schema file (.XSD) for uploading multiple sponsored entities helps sponsoring entities who are familiar with \\nXML codes to create an XML file containing sponsored entity and sponsored subsidiary branch data that can be uploaded \\nto the FATCA Online Registration system. The targeted users of these  instruction s should have basic working knowledge \\nof XML and prior experience with creating XML files.   For users unfamiliar with XML who still wish to use the electronic \\nfile submission option for inputting sponsored entities, additional information is available at FATCA: Information for \\nAdding Multiple Sponsored Entities Using a Fi le Upload .  \\nThe .XSD file defines all required and optional XML elements and attributes. It can be used to validate an XML file. The validation criteria are based on the special rules and restrictions associated with the required fields for sponsored enti ties \\nand sponsored subsidiary branches in the FATCA Online Registration system. Below are the step -by-step instructions on \\nhow to create the XML file for uploading.  \\nNOTE : For the purpose of this document, sponsored entity generally refers to any of the three sponsored entity \\nclassifications, unless otherwise indicated.   \\n                                                                                                                                             \\n116 \\nInstructions for Creating the Sponsored Entity XML File  \\nDownload and unzip the XML Schema zip file in a compatible XML editor.

Nor does this schedule cover \\npolicy records documenting the legal establishment, goals, objectives, development, implementation, modification, and termination of agency grant and cooperative agreement programs.

This sch edule \\nalso does not cover government -wide systems like \\nGRANTS .GOV and USA SPENDING .GOV. \\n A grant is an award of financial assistance in the form of money, or property in lieu of money, by the Federal Government to an eligible grantee.  The principal purpose of such award is to transfer a thing of value from a Federal agency to a State or local government or other recipient to carry out a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by Federal statute (31 U.S.C. 6304).  A cooperative agreement is an award of financial assistance that is used to enter into the same kind of relationship as a grant.  It is distinguished from a grant in that it provides for substantial involvement between the grant-making Federal agency and \\nthe award recipient in carrying out the activity contemplated by the award (31 U.S.C. 6305).  A grant or cooperative agreement shall be us ed only when the \\nprincipal purpose of a transaction is to accomplish a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by Federal statute.

Most of these records are administrative housekeeping records. Agencies create and maintain administrative records when carrying out general, non -\\nmission-related activities that keep an office operating. In contrast, agencies create mission records when  carrying  out the unique activities for which the agency \\nwas esta blished. The only mission -related records this schedule covers are non-recordkeeping copies of electronic records (item 020) that are maintained for \\ndecision-making purposes  or taking action. Co pies maintained solely for convenience of reference are considered non -record materials.  This  schedule may  be \\napplied to records in offices that carry out mission -related activities , but only those records that are described here.  \\n \\nThis schedule does not apply to transitory records, which are scheduled in GRS 5.2. The distinction between transitory and the records  covered in this schedule  is \\nthat the  records  here generally have a longer period of business use than transitory records.

When implementing this GRS, agencies should \\nconsult the FAQs about GRS 6.1, Email and Other Electronic Messages Managed under a Capstone Approach.  Agencies are reminded that this GRS should not be \\nimplemented in isolation and should be supplemented with agency -wide policies and training.  Agencies must also incorporate this GRS into agency records \\nmanagement implementation tools, such as manuals and file plans. Agencies adopting a Capstone approach should consult other r esources related to email and \\nelectronic message management, specifically  the Capstone approach av ailable on NARA???s email management page .  \\n Agencies must not implement this GRS until obtaining approval of NARA form 1005 (NA-1005), Verification for Implementing GRS 6.1 . Agencies are required to \\nobtain approval of a resubmitted NA -1005 at least  every four years. Additional information, including a link to the form, may be found in the FAQs and in the \\ninstructions accompanying the form.   \\n \\nGRS Sco p\\ne \\n \\nThis GRS provides disposition authority for email records and certain types of electronic messages.  Agencies using this GRS must apply it to email records, but may choose to also apply it to the other allowable types of electronic messages outlined below; this must be documented on the NA -1005.  Agencies wishing to \\nschedule electronic messages outside the scope of this GRS may submit an agency -specific schedule proposing a different scope.  \\n Email  \\n This GRS applies to all email, regardless of how the email messages are managed or what email technology is used. Email, in the context of this GRS, also includes any associated attachments. This GRS may apply to records affiliated with other commonly available functions of email programs such as \\ncalendars/appointments and tasks.  \\n Other Types of Electronic Messages  \\n The GRS does not cover all types of electronic messages.  Agencies may choose to use this GRS for instant messages, text messages, and chat messages that \\nserve a similar purpose as email to facilitate communication and information sharing.  This includes:  \\n \\n??? messages affiliated with email system cha t or messaging functions, and where the messages are managed independently from the email;  \\n??? messages from messaging services provided on mobile devices; and \\n??? messages from messaging services on third-party applications.  \\n \\nExclusions to all items below: \\n128Last updated in Transmittal No. 3 3  General Records Schedule 6.1 \\nJanuary 2023  \\n \\n ??? messages affiliated with social media accounts/social media direct messaging services;  \\n??? messages affiliated with messaging services provided on video conferencing applications and services;  \\n??? voice mail (or similarly recorded) messages;  \\n??? messages affiliated with collaboration platforms; and  \\n??? messages from messaging systems that are ancillary to the purpose of a larger system (for example, a chat function built into  a procurement system). \\n \\nThese records still require NARA-approved disposition authority but are  not covered under this GRS. See the GRS 6.1 FAQ for specific examples of the inclusions \\nand exclusions.   \\nAdditional Scope  \\n \\nEach agency is responsible for determining the scope of implementation when using Capstone, including, 1) whether implementation is  to include only email, or \\nto also include other types of electronic messages; 2) The range of implementation in an organization (agency -wide, specific office, etc.); and 3) the range of \\nimplementation regarding email and/or other types of electronic messa ging technology and system platforms. Brief information on the scope of an agency???s \\nCapstone implementation is also required on the NA -1005.  \\n Agencies are also responsible for defining (and documenting through policy) the official recordkeeping version of email and/or other types of electronic messages to be managed under a Capstone approach, especially when records are captured or retained in multiple locations (e.g., an email archive vs. the live \\nsystem).  Agencies will need to determine the appropriate disposition for other versions of email and other types of records, whether disposable under GRS 5.1, \\nitem 020, or as non -record.   \\n Agencies are expected to apply documented selection criteria to cull the records of Capstone officials (permanent accounts) to the greatest extent possible before transfer to NARA. Culling refers to the removal ??? or otherwise excluding from capture ??? of nonrecord, personal, or transitory messages and attachments. \\nCulling typically includes the removal of spam, message blasts re ceived (such as agency -wide communications), and personal materials (such as emails or \\nmessages to family members not related to agency business). Culling may be manual, automated, or a hybrid of both. Agencies may develop their own policies and procedures  for the culling of temporary accounts.  \\n Applying this GRS  \\n When applying this GRS in part, agencies must ensure that all other records are covered by another NARA -approved disposition authority. Agencies NOT \\nmanaging any of their email or other types of electronic messages under the Capstone approach are still responsible for managing these records by applying NARA -approved records schedules.  \\n  \\nIf an agency is implementing a Capstone disposition approach different from what is provided in this GRS, the agency must submit a records schedule. For example, an agency may want to narrow the list of required positions in item 010, use shorter retention lengths for temporary  records, or extend the time frame \\nfor transfer of permanent records. Agencies who wish to use Capstone for a broader range of electronic messages, specifically those excluded from this GRS, may also submit an agency -specific schedule.  \\n129Last updated in Transmittal No. 3 3  General Records Schedule 6.1 \\nJanuary 2023  \\n \\n  \\nItem  Records Description  Disposition \\nInstruction  Disposition \\nAuthority  \\n010 Email and other electronic messages of Capstone officials.   \\nCapstone Officials are senior officials designated by account or position level.

See Pub. 570, available at \\nwww.irs.gov/Pub570.Part I???Income From the U.S. Virgin Islands \\n(USVI)\\nSource of income. The rules for determining the source \\nof income are explained in sections 861 through 865 and \\n937, Regulations section 1.937-2, and chapter 2 of Pub. \\n570. Some general rules are: \\n??? The source of wages, salaries, or tips is generally where \\nthe services are performed. If you worked both in and \\noutside the USVI, include on line 1 only wages, salaries, \\nor tips earned while you were in the USVI. However, \\ncertain income earned while temporarily performing  \\nservices in the USVI will not be considered USVI source \\nincome. For details, see De minimis exception, later. \\nActive duty U.S. Armed Forces. If you are a bona fide \\nresident of the USVI and are stationed outside of the \\nUSVI, your military compensation will be sourced in the \\nUSVI under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA). If \\nyou are not a bona fide resident of the USVI but are \\nstationed in the USVI, however, your military \\ncompensation will not be sourced there. For further \\ndetails, see Pub. 570. \\nMilitary spouses. If you are the civilian spouse of a \\nmember of the U.S. Armed Forces, work in the USVI, and \\nretain a residence or domicile in one of the 50 states, the \\nDistrict of Columbia, or another U.S. territory, under the \\nMilitary Spouses Residency Relief Act (MSRRA) your \\nwages, salaries, tips, and self-employment income will \\nnot be considered income from the USVI. Under MSRRA, \\nthe military spouse must be in the USVI solely to be with \\ntheir servicemember spouse who is serving in compliance \\nwith military orders. For details on MSRRA, see Pub. 570. \\n??? The source of interest income is generally where the \\npayer is located. For example, interest from a certificate \\nof deposit issued by a USVI bank or a USVI branch of a \\nU.S. bank is USVI source income. \\n??? Generally, dividends are sourced where the paying \\ncorporation is created or organized. \\n??? Taxable refunds, credits, or offsets of local USVI income \\ntaxes include only nonmirror code income taxes.\\n??? Alimony received from a person who is a bona fide \\nresident of the USVI is USVI source income. \\n??? Except as provided in regulations, income that is from \\nsources within the United States or effectively connected \\nwith the conduct of a trade or business in the United \\nStates is not income from the USVI. \\n??? The source of gains, profits, or income from the sale or \\ndisposition of real property (and any interest in real \\nproperty) is generally where the real property is located. \\nPersonal property. The source of income from the sale \\nof nondepreciable personal property is generally the \\nseller???s residence. For example, if you are a U.S. citizen or \\nresident alien and not a bona fide resident of the USVI, \\ngain from the sale or disposition of personal property is \\ngenerally treated as U.S. source. Income from the sale of \\ninventory is generally sourced where the title to the \\nproperty passes. However, in some cases, such as when \\nthe taxpayer produces or purchases the inventory within \\na U.S. territory, and then sells the inventory within the \\nUnited States, source is based on allocation. See section \\n865 for details. Form 8689 (2023) Page 4 \\nDe minimis exception. This is an exception to the \\ngeneral rule for determining the source of income earned \\nin the USVI. Generally, income from the USVI does not \\ninclude compensation for services performed in the USVI \\nif during 2023 you:\\n??? Were a U.S. citizen or resident;\\n??? Were not a bona fide resident of the USVI;\\n??? Were not employed by or under contract with an \\nindividual, partnership, or corporation that is engaged in a \\ntrade or business in the USVI;\\n???

Generally, an employee who is otherwise eligible (for example, a salaried employee in a salaried only plan) must be eligible to \\nparticipate in the plan at age 21, or upon completion of 1 year of service, whichever is later.

General Rule-Once an employee, otherwise eligible, meets the statutory age and service requirements, the plan must cover him \\nor her on either the first day of the plan year after the employee has met the statutory requirements, or 6 months after the day on which \\nthe employee fulfills such requirements, which ever is earlier. There is an exception to this rule if an employee was separated from service \\nand did not return before the applicable entry date referred to above. If the separated employee returns, after either date, without incurring \\na break in service, the employer must cover the employee upon return. When a plan???s service requirements are more generous than \\nthe statute allows, the plan will qualify if the total waiting period is not longer than the statutory minimums. For example, in a plan with \\nno age or service requirement, a new employee, otherwise eligible,may be excluded until the next annual anniversary date of the plan \\nafter employment. This provision will not disqualify the plan because no employee can be required to wait longer than a 12-month period \\nunder the terms of the plan. Rules concerning a rehired employee who has a break in service are in II. j. and k. and III.g. and h. of these \\nexplanations.\\nSpecial rules apply where the plan uses the elapsed time method of crediting service. These are: a plan using the elapsed time method \\nmust provide that an employee, once eligible, who satisfies the statutory age and service requirement must be covered on the first day \\nof the plan year after the employee has met the statutory requirements, or 6 months after the day on which the employee fulfills such \\nrequirements, whichever is earlier, unless the employee was separated from service before the applicable entry date. Apply different \\nrules if the separated employee returns after the applicable entry date, whether or not the employee had a period of severance. A period \\nof severance begins on the date of severance from service. A ???severance from service??? occurs either when an employee quits, retires, is \\ndischarged, or dies; or on the first anniversary of the first day of a period of absence from service for any other reason (such as vacation, \\nholiday, disability, or layoff), whichever date comes first. Thus, if an employee separates, for any reason other than quitting, retiring, or \\ndischarge and returns within 12 months, there is no period of severance. In that case, if the employee returns after either entry date, the \\nemployer must cover the employee no later than the date the absence ended, effective the first applicable entry date that occurred during \\nthe absence from service. In the case of a period of severance, if the separated employee returns after a period of severance of less than 1 \\nyear and that period includes an entry date applicable to the employee, then the employer must cover the employee no later than the date \\non which the employee ended the period of severance. Rules for a rehired employee who has incurred a 1-year period of severance are in \\nIII. g. and h. of these explanations. The above rule is illustrated in the following examples.\\nExample 1.\\nA plan provides for a minimum age requirement of 21 and a minimum service requirement of 1 year with semi-annual entry dates. \\nEmployee X, after satisfying the minimum age requirement, became disabled for 9 consecutive months and then returned to service. \\nSince X separated from service because of a disability, there is no severance from service until the first anniversary of the date the \\nseparation occurred. X therefore did not have a period of severance under the elapsed time rules. During the period of absence, \\nX completed a 1-year period of service and passed a semi-annual entry date after satisfying the minimum service requirement. \\nAccordingly, the plan must make X a participant no later than the return to service, effective as of the applicable entry date.\\nExample 2.\\nEmployee B, after satisfying the minimum age and service requirements, quit work (date the period of severance begins) before the \\nnext semi-annual entry date, and then returned to service before incurring a 1-year period of severance but after the semi-annual entry \\ndate.

For plan years beginning before January 1, 1988, a defined benefit plan or a target benefit plan may exclude an employee because \\nof maximum age, provided the maximum age specified is not more than 5 years before a plan???s normal retirement age. An employee may \\nbe denied entrance into a plan because of maximum age only if he or she commences employment within 5 years of the plan???s normal \\nretirement age. The maximum age conditions have been repealed effective for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1988, with \\nrespect to employees credited with an hour of service on or after that date. Accordingly, any employee, regardless of age, who has at least \\none hour of service after December 31, 1987, and who satisfies the otherwise applicable conditions for participation, may not be excluded \\nfrom participation on account of age beginning with the first day of the first plan year commencing in 1988. For purposes of determining \\nwhether such an employee has met the conditions for participation, all service otherwise required to be credited, including service in pre-\\n1988 plan years, must be credited regardless of whether the plan contained a maximum age exclusion prior to the first plan year beginning \\nin 1988.\\n410(a)(2) as amended by section 9203(a)(2) of Pub.

An eligibility computation period is a 12-consecutive-month period used to determine whether an employee has completed a year \\nof service for participation purposes.

If H =1000 in b, above, answer this question; otherwise check N/A. If a plan credits hours of service of periods during which no \\nduties are performed, the plan must designate the method of determining the number of hours to be credited and the method of crediting the \\nhours to the computation periods. The plan must conform to the requirements of DOL Regulations sections 2530.200b-2(b) and (c). Section \\n2530.200-2(f) of the DOL Regulations, however, also indicates that a plan is not required to state these rules if they are incorporated by \\nreference.\\nDOL Regs. 2530.200b-2(b) and (c)\\nDOL Regs. 2530.200b-2(f)\\nLine e.  In general, the plan must initially use an eligibility computation period of 12-consecutive-months, beginning with the employee???s \\nemployment commencement date. This date is the first day for which the employee is entitled to be credited with an hour of service for the \\nperformance of duties.\\nAn alternative eligibility computation period, which may be used when employment commencement dates cannot be specifically determined, \\nis specified in DOL Regulations section 2530.202- 2(e). If this alternative is properly used, check Yes to this question.\\nDOL Regs. 2530.202-2(a)&(e).\\nLine f. If eligibility computation periods under a plan are determined solely on the anniversary of employment, check N/A.\\nIn general, an eligibility computation period is used to determine whether an employee has fulfilled service requirements for admission \\ninto the plan. It can also have a continuing use in determining whether an employee or participant with no vested interest in employer-\\nderived accrued benefits remains eligible to be a plan participant under the rule of parity (see j. and k. of these explanations). To determine \\nyears of service for either initial eligibility or retention of eligibility to participate in the plan and consequent nonforfeiture of accrued benefits, \\nplans may choose one of two eligibility computation periods after the initial computation period. First, the plan may continue to measure \\nyears of service, beginning on the employment commencement date and its anniversaries, or plans may shift to the plan year. However, the \\nfirst plan year must include the last day of the initial eligibility computation period. This overlapping is essential to assure that the employee \\ndoes not lose creditable service as a result of a gap between computation periods. A shift in the eligibility computation period must be made \\nwith respect to all employees. The application of the above rules is given in the following example:\\n Assume these circumstances:\\n   12/31/81\\n   termination\\n   of service\\n 1/1/81\\n 1000 hours\\n 12/1/80 11/30/81 \\n (date of hire)\\nThe chart shows an employee is hired on December 1, 1980, and the plan year is a calendar year. The employee terminates service \\non December 31, 1981, and has a 1-year break in service (December 31,1982). The employee has no vested right in any employer \\ncontributions. The employee worked 1000 hours between January 1, 1981, and November 30, 1981, and attained 1 year of service within \\nthe 12-month period following the date of hire. Figuring the pre-break service under DOL Regulations section 2530.202-2(c), the employee \\nwould receive credit for 1 year of service from December 1, 1980 (the date of hire) to November 30, 1981, and credit for another year of \\nservice for the plan year (calendar 1981) which includes the last day of the initial eligibility computation period. Thus, the employee receives \\ncredit for 2 years of service.\\nDOL Regs. 2530.202-2(b)\\n410(a) (3) (A)\\nIf the plan uses the alternative eligibility computation period described in DOL Regulations section 2530.202-2(e), special rules apply for the \\neligibility periods following the initial computation period. If this alternative is properly used, check Yes to this question.\\nDOL Regs. 2530.202-2(e) (2)For applications submitted to conform to the 2020 RA ListPage 5\\nLine g.  The break in service rules allow a plan to disregard certain service before the employee has a break. If all of an employee???s service \\nwith an employer is counted for participation, the plan need not provide these rules. In this case DO NOT complete questions g. through \\nk. of the worksheet.\\nDepending on the definition of ???hour of service??? and the method used to count these hours, a plan may charge an employee with a break in \\nservice for eligibility computation period In which the employee fails to complete more than B hours of service. The number required for B, \\nif a certain method of counting hours is used, equals half the hours used in question b. of this section of the worksheet. Therefore, a plan \\nmay provide that an employee be charged with a break in service if in a computation period the employee fails to complete: more than 500 \\nhours of service in a plan that counts all hours of service; or, more than 435 hours of the basis used is ???hours worked???; or, more than 375 \\nif the basis is ???regular time hours.???\\nDOL Regs. 2530.200b-3\\nDOL Regs. 2530.200b-4\\nLine h. To apply the break in service rules, the plan must use the same computation periods to measure breaks in service that it uses to \\nmeasure prior service for eligibility to participate. When a plan defines a year of service as 1000 (870 or 750) hours and an employee has \\nhours of service of more than 500 (435 or 375) but less than 1000 (870 or 750) hours, there is no break in service even though the plan will \\nnot credit the employee with a year of service.\\nDOL Regs. 2530.200b-4(a) (2)\\nLine i.  An individual shall be credited with certain hours of service if such individual is absent from work for any period by reason of 1) \\npregnancy of the individual, 2) birth of a child of the individual, 3) placement of a child with the individual in connection with an adoption \\nor 4) caring for a child described in (2) or (3) immediately following such birth or placement. This credit is credit for maternity or paternity \\nleave. Credit for maternity or paternity leave is only made to avoid a break in service and not to obtain a year of service. The absence does \\nnot have to be approved leave.\\nCredit for maternity or paternity leave is required only if such leave is on account of the reasons described above. Thus if an individual quits \\nemployment with employer A and two years later adopts a child, no credit under this provision would be given if the individual eventually \\nreturns to work for employer A because said individual???s absence from employer A???s workplace is on account of quitting and not on account \\nof the adoption of or the caring for the child immediately following the adoption.\\nHours of service must be credited to the computation period in which the first hour of maternity or paternity leave occurs, if such individual \\nwould experience a break in service with respect to such computation period if such maternity or paternity leave is not credited and \\nsuch individual will not experience a break in service if such maternity or paternity leave is credited. If such maternity or paternity leave is \\nnot credited to the first computation period, it is credited to the second computation period whether or not it is needed to preclude a break \\nin service.  \\nThe rules may be illustrated with the following example: Individual A separates from service on March 1, 1986, of a calendar year computation \\nperiod after earning 300 hours of service. The plan defines a year of service as a computation period in which the employee earns 1000 \\nhours. The employer provides for paid maternity leave for a period not to exceed 300 hours.\\nUnder the normal rules of crediting service paid maternity leave must be credited for service. Therefore, individual A in 1986 would not \\nexperience a break in service even if the hours required to be credited under REA are not so credited. Accordingly, no hours of service \\nwould be credited to the first computation period in 1986. Therefore, all such hours of service are credited in the second computation period \\nof 1987.\\nThe number of hours credited with respect to a computation period is the number of hours such individual would normally have worked in \\nthe computation period if such individual were not on maternity or paternity leave. If the number is not ascertainable, the plan may credit \\n8 hours with respect to any date said individual is absent on maternity or paternity leave. The plan may limit the number of hours credited \\nto any computation period to the number of hours needed to avoid a break in service, i.e., 501 hours, 436 hours, or 376 hours depending \\non how hours are counted. The plan may provide that the participant has the burden of proving that the absence was by reason of one of \\nthe covered causes.\\nThe plan can use a simplified method for complying with the requirements relating to maternity and paternity absences. If the plan???s break in \\nservice rules require a minimum of six consecutive one year breaks in service for service to be disregarded (versus the statutory minimum \\nof five), then the plan will not have to include any special rules relating to maternity and paternity absence. This simplified method is \\navailable only if the plan computes years of service on the basis of hours of service or permitted equivalencies. It does not apply to elapsed \\ntime plans.\\n410(a)(5)(E)\\n1.401(a)-9\\nLines j. and k.  In general, an employee???s pre-break service does not have to be credited until the employee has completed 1 year of \\nservice after the break. This should not be confused with the following rule of parity. If a participant with no vested interest has a break in \\nservice under the rule of parity, service before the break need not be counted for participation if the number of consecutive 1-year breaks \\nequals or is more than the greater of 5 or the aggregate years of service completed before the break. The aggregate years of service \\ncompleted before the break does not include years of service that need not be counted because of earlier breaks. In the case of a plan For applications submitted to conform to the 2020 RA ListPage 6\\ndescribed in section 410(a) (1) (B) (i), that is, a plan that provides for 100 percent vesting after 2 years of service, an employee who has \\nnot met the plan???s service requirement and has a one year break in service need not have pre-break service taken into consideration for \\npurposes of meeting the plan???s service requirement.\\nWhen an employee???s pre-break service must be taken into account after a year of service, an employee who meets the plan???s eligibility \\nrequirements and has a break need to be credited with the pre-break service until completion of a year of service after returning. However, \\nat that time the employee would be required to retro-actively participate under the plan. The following examples illustrate this rule:\\nExample 1.\\nA calendar year plan provides that an employee may enter the plan on the first semi-annual entry date, January 1, or July 1, after \\nsatisfying the minimum age and service requirements. Employee C, after working 10 years, separated from service in 1976 with \\na vested benefit. On February 1, 1990, C returns to employment covered by the plan. C then completes a year of service. C must \\nparticipate either immediately on returning or, after the year of service, retroactively to February 1, 1990. The prior service cannot be \\ndisregarded because of the vested benefit C had upon separation; therefore, the plan may not postpone participation until July 1,1990.\\nExample 2.\\nA defined contribution plan has a 1-year service requirement for participation and no age requirement. Contributions and allocations \\nare made for eligible employees on December 31. An employee is hired on January 1, 1985, and works 1000 hours in 1985 and 600 \\nhours in 1986. On June 30, 1986, the employee separates from service without a vested interest. The employee then has a break in \\nservice for the years 1987, 1988, and 1989. The employee returns on July 1, 1990. In accordance with the break in service rules, the \\nplan provides that the employee must complete 1 year of service after returning before the pre-break service is credited (year 1985). \\nTherefore, no contribution need be made on the employee???s behalf on December 31, 1990, because the employee is not eligible \\nto participate at that time. On June 30, 1991, the employee completes 1 year of service and is credited with the pre-break service. \\nBecause the number of consecutive breaks in service is less than 5, the pre-break service may not be ignored; thus the employee must \\nparticipate retroactively from July 1, 1990. If the employee is not covered on December 31, 1990, the waiting period is longer than the \\nmaximum allowed, taking into account the pre-break service.\\n410(a)(5)(C) & (D)\\n1.410(a)-4\\nIII. Years of Service and Breaks in Service Based on Elapsed Time\\nIf the plan has no service requirement or does not use an elapsed time method of crediting years of service for eligibility, DO NOT complete \\nthis section.\\nUnlike the general method of crediting service for an employee, which is based on hours and years of service, the elapsed time alternative \\ngenerally credits an employee with the total time that elapses during his or her employment. This alternative lessens the administrative \\nburdens of maintaining records of hours of service. It enables the employer to credit service from date of employment to date of severance \\nwithout counting hours of service completed during that time.\\nLine a.  The employment commencement date must be no later than the date on which the employee first performs an hour of service \\nfor the employer. The severance from service date is the earlier of the date an employee quits, retires, is discharged, or dies, or the \\nfirst anniversary of the first day of a period of absence from service for any reason other than quitting, retiring, discharge, or death. The \\nemployee must be credited with a period of service equal to at least the time between the employment commencement date and the \\nseverance from service date.\\n1.410(a)-7(b)\\nLine b.  Generally, a plan must aggregate all separate periods of service, except any that may be disregarded because of the rule of \\nparity. (See III. h.) Alternatively, instead of keeping separate periods of service, the plan may aggregate by adjusting the employment \\ncommencement date. If the plan used the alternative to credit the aggregate period of service, check Yes for question b.\\n1.410(a)-7(b) (6) (ii)\\n1.410(a)-7(b) (2) (iv)\\nLine c.  A period of severance is the time between the employee???s severance from service date and the date the employee again performs \\nan hour of service for the same employer.\\nIf an employee severs from service by quitting, being discharged, or retiring, and then performs an hour of service within 12 months of the \\nseverance from service date, the plan must consider the period of severance as a period of service.\\nAlso, if an employee severs from service for any reason other than quitting, being discharged, or retiring, and within the next 12 months or \\nless quits, is discharged, or retires and then performs an hour of service within 12 months of the date on which he or she was first absent \\nfrom service, the plan must consider that period of severance as a period of service.\\n1.410(a)-7(c) (2) (iii)For applications submitted to conform to the 2020 RA ListPage 7\\nLine d.  When a plan has a service requirement and uses the elapsed time method of crediting service, an employee must be considered \\nto have satisfied that requirement as of the date he or she has credit for a period of service equal to the requirement. All periods of service, \\nexcept those disregarded due to the rule of parity, must be aggregated. Certain periods of severance must be considered as periods of \\nservice (see question c) when determining this eligibility date.\\nSection I deals with the date an employee must begin participation in these situations.\\n1.410(a)-7(c) (2)\\nLine e. The break in service rules allow a plan to disregard certain service before the employee has a break. If all of an employee???s \\nservice with an employer is counted for participation, the break in service rules need not be provided by the plan. In this case, check \\nN/A for questions e. through h. of the worksheet. If a plan uses elapsed time substitute ???1-year period of severance??? for ???1-year break in \\nservice.??? A 1-year period of severance is a 12-consecutive-month period beginning on the severance from service date and ending on the \\nfirst anniversary of that date provided that within this period the employee does not perform an hour of service for the employer maintaining \\nthe plan.\\n1.410(a)-7(c) (4)\\nLine f. An individual shall not incur the first 12-month period of severance that would otherwise be counted if severance is due to maternity \\nor paternity leave. Such 12-month period is neither counted as a year of service nor as a period of severance. Maternity or paternity leave \\nis a period an individual is absent from work by reason of 1) pregnancy of the individual, 2) birth of the child of the individual, 3) placement \\nof a child with the individual for adoption or 4) caring for a child described in (2) or (3).\\nCredit for maternity or paternity leave is required only if such leave is on account of the reasons described above. Thus, if an individual quits \\nemployment with employer A and two years later adopts a child, no credit under this provision could be given if the individual eventually \\nreturns to work for employer A because such individual???s absence from employer A???s workplace is on account of quitting and not on account \\nof the adoption of or the caring for the child immediately following the adoption.\\nIf an individual works until July 1, 1986, is first absent from employment on July 1, 1986 on account of maternity or paternity leave, and on \\nJuly 1, 1989 performs an hour of service, the period of service must include the period from the employment commencement date until \\nJune 30, 1987 (one year after the date of separation for a reason other than an employee quitting, retirement, discharge or death). The \\nperiod from July 1, 1987 to June 30, 1988 is neither a period of service nor a period of severance. The period of severance would be from \\nJuly 1, 1988 to June 30,1989.\\n410(a)(5)(E)\\n1.410(a)-9\\nLines g. and h. In general, an employee???s service before a 1-year period of severance is not required to be credited until the employee \\ncompletes a 1-year period of service after the period of severance. The rule of parity applies to employees who are not vested. If a participant \\nwith no vested interest has a 5-year or more period of severance, service before the severance need not be counted for participation if the \\nperiod of severance equals or is more than the aggregate periods of service before the break. The period of service completed before the \\nperiod of severance does not include service that need not be counted because of earlier periods of severance.  \\nWhen service before a 5-year or more period of severance must be taken into account after a 1-year period of service, an employee who \\nmeets the plan???s eligibility requirements and has a 1-year period of severance need not be credited with pre-break service until he or \\nshe completes a 1-year period of service after severance. However, at that time the employee would be required to participate under the \\nplan retroactively. The following examples illustrate this rule:  \\nExample 1.\\nA calendar year plan provides that an employee may enter the plan only on the first semi-annual entry date, January 1, or July 1, \\nafter satisfying minimum age and service requirements. Employee C, after 10 years of service, separated from service in 1976 with a \\nvested benefit. On February 1, 1990, C returns to employment covered by the plan and completes a 1-year period of service. C must \\nparticipate either immediately on returning or, after a 1-year period of service, retroactively to February 1, 1990. C???s prior service cannot \\nbe disregarded because of the vested benefit C had when separating from service. Therefore, the plan may not postpone participation \\nuntil July 1, 1990.\\nExample 2.\\nA defined contribution plan has a 1 year service requirement for participation, and no age requirement. Contributions and allocations \\nare made for eligible employees on December 31. An employee is hired on January 1, 1985, and separates from service without a \\nvested interest on June 30, 1987. The employee returns on July 1, 1990, after a 3-year period of severance. Under the break in service \\nrules, the plan provides that the employee must complete a 1-year period of service after returning before the 2??-year period of pre-\\nbreak service is credited. Therefore, no contribution need be made on the employee???s behalf on December 31, 1990, because the \\nemployee is not eligible to participate at that time. On June30, 1991, the employee completes a 1-year period of service and is credited \\nwith the pre-break service and must participate retroactively from July 1, 1990 because the period of severance is less than 5 years. If \\nthis employee is not covered on December 31, 1990, the waiting period is longer than the maximum allowed, taking into account the \\npre-break period of service.For applications submitted to conform to the 2020 RA List\\nForm5622 (Rev. 6-2021) Catalog Number 42697Z publish.no.irs.gov Department of the Treasury - Internal Revenue ServiceEmployee Benefit Plan\\nMinimum Participation Standards \\n(Worksheet Number 1 ???

Overview   \\n(1) Section 501(a) provides for the tax exemption of certain organizations , including \\nthose described in Section 501(c) . Many categories of organizations are listed \\nunder Section 501(c) . Each category has different requirements that must be met \\nfor an organization to be described under that category.  \\n(2) One of the most common types of tax-exempt  organizations , due to its ability to \\nreceive tax -deduc tible contributions  (as well as other benefits)  are those \\ndescribed in Section 501(c)(3) .  \\nA. Introduction to Section 501(c )(3)  \\n(1) Section 501(c)(3) organizations are often referred to collectively as ???charities??? or \\n???charitable organizations.??? However, permitted Section 501(c)(3) purposes include  religious, charitable, scientific, testing for public safety, literary, \\neducational, the fostering of national or international amateur sports \\ncompetition, or the prevention of cruelty to children or animals .  \\n(2) Specific requirements must be met to qualify for tax exemption under Section 501(c)(3). Failure to satisfy any of the requirements results in an organization not qualifying for exempt status when applying for recognition of exemption or  \\ncan result in the loss of such status once a violation is detected by the IRS.  \\n(3) These organizations  are eligible to receive tax -deductible contributions unlike \\nmost other exempt organizations. They also enjoy other benefits under the IRC, as well as under state or local income, property, sales, use, or other tax provisions.  \\n(4) Section  501(c)(3) organizations are classified as either public charit ies or \\nprivate foundations. In general, the basis for distinguishing between public \\ncharities and private foundations is the level of public support an organization receives over time. Also, c ertain organizations may qualify as public charities as \\na matter of law. Compar ed to public charities, p rivate foundations are subject to \\nmore restrictions on their activities  and are subject to certain excise taxes . \\nAdditionally,  charitable contribution deductibility is less favorable for private \\nfoundations . \\n(5) This technical guide discusses Section 501(c)(3) organizations providing an \\noverview  of: \\na. Exemption requirements  \\nb. Other considerations  (for example, foundation status, employment tax \\nrequirements and so forth.)  \\nc. Application requirements for exemption  \\nd. Return filing requirements  \\ne. Examination techniques   \\nf. Other resources  -8-   B. Backgro und / History   \\n(1) The 16th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was ratified on February 3, 1913,  \\nallowing for the levying of income tax . Congress then enacted the Revenue Act \\nof 1913, Ch. 16, 38 Stat. 114, on October 3, 1913 (also known as the \\nUnderwood Tariff Act ). This act established ???charitable??? as a purpose that is \\nexempt from federal income tax.  \\n(2) In 1939 the Internal Revenue Code was codified, and organizations pursuing \\ncharitable activities were exempt from taxation under Section 101(6). The recodification of the C ode in 1954, as the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, \\nredesigned and reordered the code to designate organizations exempt from federal i ncome tax under Section 501(c)(3) where ???charitable??? remained an \\nexempt purpose.  \\n(3) The Tax Reform Act of 1969 expanded Section 501(c)(3) law by providing:  \\na. Organizations created after October 9, 1969,  won???t  be treated as an \\norganization described in Section 501(c)(3) unless they apply for exemption. Exceptions apply  See Section  508.  \\nb. Organizations described in Section 501(c)(3) are presumed to be private foundations unless they meet one of the ex ceptions list ed in Section \\n509(a).  \\nc. Special private foundation rules.  \\n(4) Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 provides for the exemption of organizations organized and operated exclusively for ???charitable??? purposes.  \\nC. Citation of Law and Non -Precedential Guidance \\n(1) Throughout this Guide, citations of law are provided as guidance on the government???s position on specific activities and actions of the exempt organization.  \\n(2) While the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) is the primary source of Federal tax law, there are many additional sources. For example, there are both administrative and judicial interpretations as well. Administrative materials include Treasury Regulations, Revenue Rulings, and Revenue Procedures. Federal Courts that interpret Federal tax law include trial courts, appellate  \\ncourts, and ultimately the Supreme Court.  \\n(3) Committee reports issued by Congressional committees during the legislative process are useful tools in determining Congressional intent behind certain tax laws and help examiners apply the law properly , particularly with respect to \\nnovel issues where the literal language of the IRC is ambiguous, where there is \\nlittle to no judicial history, and/or when the Treasury has not drafted regulations.  \\n(Note:  Agents encountering novel i ssues in a case where there is little to  no \\nlaw on point should contact Counsel for assistance with the case. ) -9-   C.1. Precedential Citation of Law \\n(1) When citing case law, follow Internal Revenue Manual (IRM) 4.75.13.10 and \\n4.10.7.2 for the proper citation of law . The following is the order of precedential \\nauthori ties the IRS follows when reviewing cases.   \\n(2) Internal Revenue Code (Title 26 of the United States Code) is the foundation \\nfor all tax law. When changes are made to the IRC, the old language is deleted, and new language is inserted. Originally codified in 1939 as the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, it was recodified in 195 4 and 1986. It is now \\nreferred to as the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The IRC is divided into subtitles, chapters, subchapters, parts, subparts, sections, subsections, paragraphs, subparagraphs and clauses.  \\n(3) Treasury Regulations assist in interpreting the IRC. The regulations often \\ncontain examples and computations that assist in understanding the statutory language. The regulations are issued as proposed, temporary and final. References made to specific regulations throughout this TG are notated as Treas.  Reg.  \\n(4) Revenue Rulings provide guidance on the government???s position on specific \\nactivities and actions of an exempt organization. References made to specific \\nrevenue rulings throughout this TG are notated as Rev. Rul.  The purpose of \\nrevenue rulings and rev enue procedures is to promote uniform application of \\nthe tax laws. IRS employees must follow revenue rulings and revenue procedures. Taxpayers may rely on them or appeal their position to the Tax Court or other federal court.  \\n(5) Revenue Procedures are IRS pronouncements that deal with procedural \\naspects of the law. Specific reference to revenue procedures throughout this \\nTG are notated as Rev. Proc.  \\n(6) Rulings and procedures are published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin  \\n(I.R.B.) available on www.irs.gov. Note:  Rulings and procedures were \\npreviously published weekly  in a paper version of the I.R.B. and semiannually \\nin the Cumulative Bulletin (C.B.) . On March 11, 2013, the IRS announced it \\nwould stop printing the paper I.R.B. and eliminated the C.B. after the 2008- 2 \\nedition. See Ann. 2013- 12. \\n(7) Judicial decisions comprise an important source of tax law. Judges are \\nreputed to be unbiased individuals who render decisions on questions of fact and/or law. Judges do not always agree. So often, a decision must be made against a background of conflicting judicial authorities.  \\na. Trial Courts \\nThere are three trial courts for tax adjudication in the United States: the \\nU.S. Tax Court, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims and the U.S. District \\nCourts.  -10-   b. Appellate Courts \\nDecisions can be appealed from the U.S. Tax Court and the U.S. District \\nCourts to the Court of Appeals in the taxpayer???s circuit. Appeals from the U.S. Court of Federal Claims are taken to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. A party who loses at an appellate level may ask the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari to argue the case.  \\nc. US Supreme Court  \\nDecisions of the U.S. Courts of Appeal, including the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, may be appealed to the United States Supreme Court. The Supreme Court of the United States is the highest court of the land. In general, Supreme Court review is discretionary. The Supreme Court accepts cases which it views as having national importance. Only a limited number of tax cases are heard.  \\n(8) Committee Reports indicate legislative intent to a proposed bill. The Ways \\nand Means Committee in the House of Representatives and the Finance Committee in the Senate are responsible for tax legislation. In cases where the literal language of the IRC is ambiguous, Committee Reports are useful tools in determining Congressional intent behind certain tax laws and help examiners apply the law properly.  \\nC.2. Legal Guidance  \\n(1) Treatment of IRS Official Rulings and Procedures:  In St. David\\'s Health \\nCare System. v. United States, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals noted that ???the courts generally accord significant weight to the determinations of the IRS in its revenue rulings.??? 349 F.3d 232, 239 n.9 (5th Cir. 2003); see Estate of McLendon v. Commissioner, 135 F.3d 1017, 1023 n.10, 1024 (5th Cir.1998) \\n(stating ???revenue rulings are generally given weight as expressing the studied view of the agency whose duty it is to carry out the statute,??? but are ???clearly less binding on the courts than treasury regulations or Code provisions???).  \\n(2) An IRS Action on Decision (AOD) - is a formal memorandum prepared by \\nthe IRS Office of Chief Counsel that announces the future litigation position the IRS will take with regard to the court decision addressed by the AOD. The IRS???s AOD policy on feder al court decisions decided in the taxpayers??? favor is \\ndescribed in the Chief Counsel Directives Manual CCDM 36.3.1 (03- 14-2013), \\nor its successor.  The IRS has an acquiescence policy regarding federal court \\ndecisions decided in the taxpayers??? favor.  \\na. Acquies cence (acq.) occurs when the IRS accepts the decision and will \\nfollow the ruling in all jurisdictions.  \\nb. Non-acquiescence (nonacq.) occurs when IRS disagrees with the court \\ndecision. The IRS is required to follow the precedent in the circuit where the decision was made, but may otherwise hold its own position in all other circuits.  -11-   c. The IRS decision of acquiescence or non- acquiescence is published in the \\nCumulative Bulletin and IRS agents are bound by the determinations.  \\nC.3. Non-precedential Guidance  \\n(1) This Technical Guide and other guides will refer to non- precedential guidance \\nthroughout this discussion. This guidance may not be ci ted as precedent. It \\ndoes, however, provide the government???s position on issues and assists with \\ndeveloping a fact pattern as well as application of the law to the facts of a case for revenue agent reports. The non- precedential guidance presented in this \\nTechnical Guide is as follows:  \\na. Technical advice memorandum  (TAM) is guidance furnished by the \\nOffice of Chief Counsel upon the request of an IRS director or an area director, appeals, in response to technical or procedural questions that \\ndevelop during a pr oceeding. A request for a TAM generally stems from \\nan examination of a taxpayer\\'s return, a consideration of a taxpayer\\'s \\nclaim for a refund or credit, or any other matter involving a specific taxpayer under the jurisdiction of the territory manager or the area \\ndirector, appeals. A TAM is issued only on closed transactions and provide the interpretation of proper application of tax laws, tax treaties, regulations, revenue rulings or other precedents. The advice rendered represents a final determination of t he position of the IRS, but only with \\nrespect to the specific issue in the specific case in which the advice is issued. TAMs are generally made public after all information has been removed that could identify the taxpayer whose circumstances triggered a specific memorandum.  \\nb. Private letter ruling (PLR) is a written statement issued to a taxpayer that \\ninterprets and applies tax laws to the taxpayer\\'s specific set of facts. A PLR is issued to establish with certainty the federal tax consequences of a particul ar transaction before the transaction is consummated or before the \\ntaxpayer\\'s return is filed. A PLR is issued in response to a written request submitted by a taxpayer and is binding on the IRS if the taxpayer fully and accurately described the proposed tr ansaction in the request and carries \\nout the transaction as described. A PLR may not be relied on as precedent by other taxpayers or IRS personnel. PLRs are generally made public after all information has been removed that could identify the taxpayer to whom it was issued.  \\nc. General counsel memorandum  (GCM) is a formal legal opinion of the \\nchief counsel responding to inquiries from a National Office function outside of chief counsel or explaining the legal basis for the position taken in a TAM, letter ruling,  or revenue ruling. GCMs are generally made public \\nafter all information has been removed that could identify the taxpayer to whom it was issued.  \\nd. IRS publications explain the law in plain language for taxpayers and their \\nadvisors. They typically highlight changes in the law, provide examples illustrating Internal Revenue Service positions, and include worksheets. -12-   Publications are nonbinding on the Service and do not necessarily cover \\nall positions for a given issue. While a useful source of general informat ion, publications should not be cited to sustain a position. \\nPublications may be found on the published products catalog and may be searched by title, catalog number, product number, or key word search.  \\nD. Relevant Terms  \\n(1) Charity or Charitable Organization:  A term commonly used to refer to \\norganizations described in Section 501(c)(3).  \\n(2) Cy Pres: The term ???cy pres??? comes from French language and means ???so near??? \\nor ???as near as possible.??? The cy pres  doctrine provides that where the particular \\npurpose of a charitabl e trust has become impossible, impractical, or illegal to \\ncarry out and the trust settlor had a more general charitable intent, a court has the power to direct the trust property to a charitable purpose that falls within the general charitable intent of the settlor . See Restatement of Trusts (Second) \\n399. \\n(3) Determination Letter : A letter issue d by the IRS recognizing an organization???s \\nexempt status and providing its foundation classification i f an application for \\nexemption and all information received by t he IRS establishes than an \\norganization meets the requirements for exemption.  \\n(4) Dissolution: The method by which an organization exempt under Section \\n501(c)(3) ceases operations and distributes i ts net assets for one or more \\nexempt purposes. to a governmental entity or to another 501(c)(3) organization.   \\n(5) Inter -vivos Trust:  A trust created during the lifetime of a grantor which \\ntransfers legal title of trust property to a trustee to hold and to manage for a third party in accordance with the intent of the grantor.  \\n(6) Operation:  The act or process of operating or functioning.  \\n(7) Organization:  Bodies of persons formed f or a particular purpose.  \\n(8) Revocation:  The loss of tax -exempt status by an organization initiated by the \\nIRS. (Note: Automatic revocation, described in Section 6033(j) , happens by \\noperati on of law rather than actions initiated by the IRS.)  \\n(9) Tax-Exempt Organization:  An organization described in Section 501(c) or (d) \\nand exempt from taxation (under Title 26 of United States Code).  \\nE.

Exemption Requirements  \\n(1) Organizations must  meet all of the following requirements to qualify for \\nexemption under Section 501(c)(3) : \\na. Organized and operated exclusively for Section 501(c)(3) purposes   \\nb.  None of its  earnings may inure to any private shareholder or indi vidual  \\nc. No more than an incidental private benefit to private persons  \\nd. No substantial part of the organization???s activities may attempt to influence \\nlegislation (lobbying)  \\ne. May not participate or intervene in any political campaign for or against \\nany candidate for public office \\nf. Purposes and activities may not be illegal or violate fundamental public \\npolicy  \\ng. See Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1. \\nG. Organizational and Operational Test  Requirement s \\n(1) Section 501(c)(3) requires an organization to be both ???organized??? and ???operated??? exclusively for one or more Section 501(c)(3) purposes. If the organization fails either the organizational test or the operational test, it isn???t exempt. See Treas. Reg. 1. 501(c)(3) -1(a)(1). \\n(2) The following organizations (described elsewhere within Section 501) are treated as charitable organizations described within Section 501(c)(3) and generally are subject to their own organizational and operational requirements:  \\na. Cooperati ve hospital service organizations (Section 501(e))  \\nb. Cooperative service organizations of operating educational organizations (Section 501(f)).  \\nc. Childcare organizations (Section 501(k))  \\nd. Charitable risk pools (Section 501(n))  \\ne. Credit counseling organizations ( Section 501(q)), and  \\nf. Hospital organizations (Section 501(r)).  \\nNote:  See Technical Guide, TG 3- 6: IRC 501(c)(3) Exempt Purposes Testing \\nfor Public Safety, Literary, Fostering Amateur Sports, Prevention of Cruelty to \\nChildren or Animals, and Other 501(c)(3) Purposes; 501(f), 501(j), 501(k), 501(m), 501(n), 501(q) . (Note:   TG 3- 6 will be published in the future. For a list \\nof all TGs published and in process, see the cumulative list of Technical Guides located in TG 0 Technical Guides Overview , Exhib it III, starting on page 10. ) \\n  -14-    \\nH. Organizational Test  \\n(1) The organizational test applies to the organization???s articles of organiz ation,  \\nalso referred to  as the ???organizing document .??? An organization may be a \\ncorporation, trust, or unincorporated association. See section V. A. 8, Entity \\nTypes and Dates of Formation of this TG .  \\n(2) The articles of organiz ation are the written instrument by which an organization \\nis created. See Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(b)(2).  \\n(3) An organization is organized exclusively f or one or more exempt purposes only \\nif its articles of organization:  \\na. Limit the purposes to one or more exempt purposes (???purpose clause???) See Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(b)(1)(i)(a); and   \\nb. Don???t expressly empower the organization to engage in activities (other than as an insubstantial part of its activit ies) that don???t  further one or more \\nexempt purposes. See Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(b)(1)(i)(b).  \\nc. Dedicate an organization???s assets to an exempt purpose (dissolution \\nprovision) either by provision in its articles  of organization or by operation \\nof law.  See Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(b)(4).  \\n(4) Placing  the provisions in the bylaws isn??? t acceptable unless : \\na. The bylaws are the articles of organization for an unincorporated \\nassociation.  or \\nb. In the case of a corporation, the state law would give effect to such a provision. (Note:  This situation is not common and, in most instances,  \\ncorporations should have dissolution clause in the organizing document filed with its state of incorporation, often called Articles of Incorporation.  \\n(5) Private foundations have additional requirements for the articles of organization imposed by Section 508(e).  See section II.B. 7. Private Foundat ions. \\n(6) The articles of organization must meet the requirements in both form and \\nlanguage. Defects in the organizing documents can???t  be corrected by the \\norganization???s actual operations or by reference to other documents , including \\nForm 1023, Application for Recognition of Exemption Under Section 501(c)(3) \\nof the IRC , or other statements.   \\n(7) See Section V. A. 8., Entity Types and Dates of Formation,  of this TG  for \\ninformation on allowable entity types and characteristics .  \\nH.1. Exempt Purpose  \\n(1) An organization???s exempt purpose must be stated in its organizing \\ndocument  to meet the organizational test. See Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -\\n1(b)(1)(ii).  \\n(2) The term exempt purpose means any purpose specified in S ection 501(c)(3):  -15-   a. Charitable  \\nb. Religious  \\nc. Scientific  \\nd. Testing for Public Safety  \\ne. Literary  \\nf. Educational  \\ng. Fostering national or international sports competitions  \\nh. Prevention of cruelty to children or animals.  \\n(3) The stated purpose may be as broad as the purposes stated in Section \\n501(c)(3). For example, the purpose can be limited exclusively to one or more \\npurposes as stated in Section 501(c)(3)  as follows : \\n \\nSaid organization is organized exclusively for charitable, religious,  \\neducational, and scientific purposes, including, for such purposes, \\nthe making of distributions to organizations that qualify as exempt  \\norganizations under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, or  the corresponding section of any future Federal tax code.  \\n(4) The stated purpose may be more specific than the purposes stated in Section \\n501(c)(3).  The following example is acceptable as a specific purpose since \\nteaching sports to children (under age 18) is considered charitable (develops \\ncharacter , prevents juvenile delinquency ): \\n \\n???The or ganiz ation will teach lacrosse to youth ages 17 and under. ???  \\n(5) The organizing document must state a purpose that necessarily falls within \\nthe purposes stated in Section 501(c)(3). The following examples  don???t  meet  \\nthe organizational test as the purposes aren???t listed under Section 501(c)(3) and may or may not be conducted for charit able purposes:  \\n???The organization will provide housing to residents of Magnolia County.???  \\n???The organization will promote the health of residents of Magnolia County.???  \\n(6) The stated purpose may not be broader  than the purposes of Section \\n501(c)(3).  For example, the following purpose statement  is too broad because \\nbettering mankind  may be achieved in many ways, not all of which fall within \\nSection 501(c)(3) : \\n  \\n???The organization is organized to better mankind in all ways that \\nare allowed  and appropriate under the law. ??? \\n(7) Organizations that are organized for both exempt and nonexempt purposes \\nfail to meet the organizational test. The following rulings contain examples of -16-   organizing documents which included nonexempt purposes  causing the \\norganizations to fail to qualify under Section 501(c)(3) :  \\na. In Rev. Rul. 69- 279, 1969- 1 C.B. 152, an irrevocable inter vivos trust was \\ncreated to pay  a fixed percentage of all income earned annually to the \\nsettlor during his lifetime (which served private interests)  with the \\nremaining balance paid to charity after the settlor???s death.  \\nb. In Rev. Rul. 69 -256, 1969- 1 C.B. 151, a testamentary trust  was \\nestablished to make annual payments to exem pt charities and to use a \\nfixed sum from annual income for the care of the testator???s burial lot  \\n(which served private interests) .  \\n(8) If the organizing document contains a purpose that doesn???t  satisfy the  \\norganizational test, but such purpose is not expressl y contrary to Section \\n501(c)(3) exempt purposes, the addition of the following type of language to \\nthe organizing document  will let  the organization meet the purpose \\nrequirement of the organizational test:  \\n \\n???Notwithstanding other language (or provisions) in the creating \\ndocument, the purposes will be limited exclusively to exempt purposes within the meaning of IRC 501(c)(3).???  \\n For example, a n organizi ng document providing that an organization is formed \\nto promote philanthropic and eleemosynary purposes wouldn ???t satisfy  \\nthe purpose requirement. But  if the organizing document also states that  \\nnotwithstanding any other provision in this instrument, it w on???t further any  \\nspecified purpose to more than an insubstantial degree other than those  \\ndescribed in IRC 501(c)(3), the organization would satisfy the organizational \\ntest. \\nH.2. Express Powers  \\n(1) The organizational test won???t be met if  the organizing document  expressly \\nempowers the organization:  \\na. To carry on any other activities (unless they are insubstantial) which aren???t in furtherance of one or more exempt purposes. See Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(b)(1)(i)(b).  \\nb. To devote more than an insubstantial part of its acti vities to influence \\nlegislation by propaganda or otherwise. S ee Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -\\n1(b)(3)(i) . \\nc. To participate directly or indirectly in or  intervene in (including the \\npublishing or distributing of statements), any political campaign on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for public office. S ee Treas. Reg. \\n1.501(c)(3) -1(b)(3)(ii).  \\n(2) To have objectives and to engage in activities which c haracterize it as an \\n???action??? organization.  See Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(b)(3)(iii).  -17-   (3) Providing for a Section 501(h) election (where an organization elects to make \\nlobbying and grass roots expenditures that don???t normally exceed the ceiling \\namounts ) in an organization???s articles won???t violate the organizational test . See \\nTreas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(b)(3) (iii). \\nH.3.  Charitable Class Requirement  \\n(1) A charitable organization or trust must be set up for the benefit of an indefinite class of individuals . It may  not be set up for specific persons.  \\n(2) A trust or corporation organized and operated for the benefit of specific individuals isn???t charitable. For example:  \\na. A trust to benefit ??? John Jones ??? isn???t a charitable trust even though the facts \\nmay show that ??? John Jones ??? is impoverished . See Pasadena Methodist \\nFoundation  and Carrie A. Maxwell, Trust, Pasadena Methodist Foundation \\nv. Commissioner, 2 TCM 905 (1943).  \\nb. However, an organization set up with the general charitable purpose of benefitting needy individuals in a particular community is a charitable organization. It  may select ??? John Jones ??? as a beneficiary.  \\n(3) An organization may have a purpose to benefit a comparatively small class of beneficiaries provided the class is open and the identities of the individuals to be benefited remain indefinite. See the following rulings:  \\na. Rev. Rul. 56 -403, 1956- 2 C.B. 307, held that a foundation set up to award \\nscholarships solely to undergraduate members of a designated fraternity could be exempt as a charitable foundation  \\nb. Rev. Rul. 67- 367, 1967- 2 C.B. 188, held that an organization that made \\nscholarship payments to pre- selected, specifically named individuals didn???t \\nqualify for exemption.  \\nc. Rev. Rul. 57 -449, 1957- 2 C.B. 622, held that a trust to pay a certain sum \\nto all the individuals enrolled in a certain school on a particular date was a private trust, and not a charitable trust since the beneficiaries were a \\ngroup of identifiable individuals .  \\nH.4.  Dissolution Provision  \\n(1) An organization???s  assets must be dedicated to an exempt purpose to meet the \\norganizational test.  \\n(2) Assets wi ll be considered properly dedicated if the articles of organization \\nprovide for distribution of assets upon dissolution:  \\na. For one or more exempt purposes,  \\nb. To the feder al government or a state or local government, for a public \\npurpose, or  \\nc. To another organization (distributed by a court) to be used in a  manner \\nthat in the judgment of the court will best carry out  the general purposes \\nfor which the dissolved organization w as organized.  -18-   See Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(b)(4).  \\n(3) The following is an example of a dissolution provision that properly dedicates \\nan organization???s assets:  \\nUpon the dissolution of this organization, assets shall be distributed for one or more exempt purposes within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, or corresponding section of any future federal tax code, or shall be distributed to the federal government, or to a state or local government, for a public purpose.  \\n(4) The laws of some states provide for the distribution of charitable assets upon dissolution when organizing articles don???t have an express dissolution clause. See the following S ections, B.5. Operation of State Law  and B.6 Cy Pres \\nDoctrine  in this TG .  \\n(5) An organization???s ass ets aren???t properly dedicated if its organizing document \\nprovides that its assets  will b e distributed to its members or shareholders upon \\ndissolution. See Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(b)(4).  \\nH.5. Operation of State Law  \\n(1) Some state laws govern the distribution of assets upon dissolution when an \\norganizations??? governing documents don???t have an express dissolution provision. If assets are properly dedicated by operation of state law, the \\norganization???s governing documents do not need a dissolution cl ause.  \\nH.6.  The Cy Pres Doctrine  \\n(1) The term ???cy pres??? comes from the French language and means ???so near??? or \\n???as near as possible. ??? The cy pres doctrine is a legal doctrine that provides  \\nwhere the particular purpose of a charitable trust has become impossible, impractical, or illegal to carry out and the trust settlor had a more general charitable intent, a court has the power to direct the trust assets to a charitable purpose that falls within the general charitable intent of the settlor . \\n(2) Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(b)(4) provides that an organization is not considered \\norganized exclusively for one or more exempt purposes unless its assets are dedicated to an exempt purpose. An organization may satisfy this requirement \\nif, by reason of a provision in the organization???s articles or by operation of state law, its assets would be distributed upon dissolution for one or more exempt purposes, or to the Federal Government, or to a State or local government, for a public purpose, or would be distributed by a court to another organization to be used in such manner as in the judgment of the court will best accomplish the general purposes for which the dissolved organization was organized.  \\n(3) In Rev. Proc . 82-2, 1982- 1 C.B. 367, the IRS identified the states and \\ncircumstances in which the Service does not require an express dissolution provision in the articles of organization because state law satisfies the requirements of Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(b)(4).  Agents and taxpayers are \\ncautioned that the information in Rev. Proc. 82- 2 has not been updated and -19-   may have been affected by subsequent changes to state law. If it is not clear \\nthat current state law satisfies the requirements of Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -\\n1(b)(4), a dissolution provision should be included in the organizing document. (See example in Section H.4(3), of this TG, above.)  \\nH.7. Private Foundation s \\n(1) Section 508(e) (1) provides that the governing instrument of a private \\nfoundation must:  \\na. Require income di stributions for each tax year so as to not subject the \\nfoundation to taxes under Section  4942, and  \\nb. Prohibit the foundation from engaging in self -dealing under Section \\n4941(d), from retaining excess business holdings under Section  4943(c), \\nfrom investing f unds in a manner subjecting the foundation to tax under \\nSection  4944, and from making any taxable expenditures under Section  \\n4945(d).  \\n(2) The governing instrument will meet Section 508(e)(1) requirements if state law  \\nrequires the foundation to act or refrain from acting so as not to subject the foundation to the taxes imposed by Sections 4941- 4945 or  treats the \\ngoverning instrument as requiring this conduct. See Treas. Reg. 1.508- 3(d)(1).  \\n(3) In Rev. Rul. 75- 38, 1975- 1 C.B. 161, the IRS published a list of states that \\nhave adopted legislation satisfying the requirements of Section 508(e). Agents and taxpayers are cautioned that the information in Rev. Rul. 75- 38 has not \\nbeen updated and may have been affected by subsequent  changes to state \\nlaw. If it is not clear that current state law satisfies the requirements of Section 508(e), then the provisions described in Section 508(e) should be added to the private foundation???s governing instrument  \\n(4) Publication 557, Tax -Exempt Stat us for Your Organization, Chapter 3, Private \\nFoundations and Public Charities, provides sample language that will meet Section 508 requirements.  \\n(5) Special circumstances and exceptions exist. See Technical Guide, TG 3- 20: \\nIntroduction to Private Foundations and Special Rules Under IRC 508.   \\nH.8. Exempt Purposes  \\n(1) An organization will be regarded as operated exclusively for one or more exempt purposes only if it engages primarily in activities which accomplish one or more Section 501(c)(3) purposes.  An organization is n???t regarded as \\noperating exclusively for exempt purposes if more than an insubstantial part of its activities doesn???t  further exempt purposes. See Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -\\n1(c)(1).  \\n(2) An organization may be exempt as an organization described in Section \\n501(c )(3) if it???s organized and operated exclusively for one or more of the \\nfollowing exempt purposes:  \\na. Religious  -20-   b. Charitable  \\nc. Scientific  \\nd. Testing for public safety  \\ne. Literary  \\nf. Educational  \\ng. Foster national or international sports competition  \\nh. Prevention of cruelty to c hildren or animals.  \\nSee Section 501(c)(3) and Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(d)(1).  \\n(3) There???s no legal definition in the IRC  for commonly used  terms such as \\n???exclusively,??? ???primarily,??? ???substantial??? and ???insubstantial??? which are found \\nthroughout the IRC and regulations. For purposes of the operational test, these  terms a pply to the review  of the purposes, activities, time and resources \\nof exempt  organizations to determine if they are operating for Section \\n501(c)(3) purposes. There is no express formula or measurement in the IRC  \\nfor the operational test . Rather, a ll facts and circumstances  pertaining to the \\noperational test should be considered when making these determinations . \\n(4) Courts have provided general guidelines  on a case- by-case basis  that \\ninterpret the commonly used terms in Section 501(c)(3) . For example, s ee \\nBetter Business Bureau of Washington D.C., Inc. v. United States , 326 U.S. \\n279 (1945), in which the Supreme Court held that the presence of a single \\nnon-exempt purpose, if substantial in nature, will destroy the exemption \\nregardless of the number or importance of truly exempt purposes . \\nH.9. Charitable Defined  \\n(1) Treas.  Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(d)(2)  provides that the ter m \"charitable??? for \\npurposes of Section 501(c)(3) is used in its ???generally accepted legal sense.??? Charitable purposes include t he purposes listed above in Section C.1. and the \\nfollowing :  \\na. Relief of the poor, the distressed, or the underprivileged  \\nb. Advancement of religion \\nc. Advancement of education or science  \\nd. Erecting or maintaining public buildings, monuments, or works  \\ne. Lessening the burdens of government  \\nf. Promotion of s ocial welfare by organizations engaging in a. through e.  \\ng. Lessening neighborhood tensions  \\nh. Eliminating prejudice and discrimination  \\ni. Defending human and civil rights secured by law  \\nj. Combating community deterioration and juvenile delinquency  -21-   (2) See Technical  Guide, TG 3- 3: Exempt Purpose, Charitable IRC 501(c)(3) .  \\nH.10.  Religious or Advancement of Religion  \\n(1) The First Amendment to the United States Constitution provides  that \\n???Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or \\nprohibiting the free exercise thereof .???  Thus, First Amendment considerations \\nprevent Congress  and the Internal Revenue Service from establishing a \\ndefinition of the term ???religion.???  See GCM 36993 (1977) . \\n(2) However, the Supreme Court did interpret the term ???religious??? in United States \\nv. Seeger,  380 U.S. 163 (1965). The Court specifically interpreted the phrase \\n???religious training and belief??? as used in the Universal Military Training and Service Act, 50 U.S.C. Section 456(j), in determining an individual???s eligibility for exemption from military  service on religious grounds. The Court expressed \\nthe following definition: ???A sincere and meaningful belief which occupies in the \\nlife of its possessor a place parallel to that filled by the God of those admittedly \\nqualifying for the exemption comes within the statutory definition.???  \\n(3) See TG 3- 2, Exempt Purpose, Religious IRC 501(c)(3) for the requirements \\nthat must be met by an organization operating for religious purposes or the advancement of religion to qualify as charitable under Section 501(c)(3) . \\n(Note: TG 3 -2 will be published in the future. For a list of all TGs published \\nand in process, see the cumulative list of Technical Guides located in TG 0 Technical Guides Overview, Exhibit III, starting on page 10. ) \\nH.11.  Educational Defined  \\n(1) The term ???charitable??? includes the advancement of education. Like the term \\n???charitable, ??? the IRC doesn???t define the term ??? educational. ??? \\n(2) The term ???educational ??? as used in Section  501(c)(3) , relates to : \\na. The instruction or training of the individual for the purpose of improving or developing his capabilities , or \\nb. The instruction of the public on subjects useful to the individual and beneficial to the community.  \\nSee Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(d)( 3). \\n(3) An organization may be educational even though it advocates a particular position or viewpoint as long as  it provides a sufficiently full and fair \\npresentation of the key facts  as to allow an individual or the public to form an \\nindependent opinion or concl usion. On the other hand, an organization isn??? t \\neducational if its principal function is the mere presentation of unsupported opinion. See Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(d)(3)(i)(b) . \\nSee Technical Guide,  TG 3-5: Exempt Purpose, Educational IRC 501(c)(3)  \\n(Note:  TG 3 -5 will be published in the future. ) -22-   H.12.  Testing for Public Safety Defined  \\n(1) The term ???testing for public safety??? includes the testing of consumer products \\n(such as electrical products ) to determin e whether t hey are safe for use by the \\ngeneral public. See Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) - 1(d)(4).  \\n(2) For detail, see Technical  Guide, TG  3-6: Exempt Purpose, Public Safety, \\nAmateur Athletics, Prevention of Cruelty, and Other IRC 501(c)(3) .  \\n(Note:   TG 3 -6 will be published i n the future. For a list of all TGs published \\nand in process, see the cumulative list of Technical Guides located in TG 0 Technical Guides Overview, Exhibit III, starting on page 10.)  \\nH.13.  Scientific Defined  \\n(1) The terms ???science ??? and ???scientific ??? are not defined in the I RC, Regulations or \\nany published rulings . However, Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(d)( 5) does  provide \\nthat a scientific organization:  \\na. Must be organized and operated in the public interest , \\nb. Includes the carrying on of scientific research in the public interest which \\nfurthers a scientific purpose, and \\nc. Doesn ???t include activi ties of a type ordinarily carried on as incident to \\ncommercial or industrial operations . \\n(2) For detail see Technical Guide, TG   3-4: Exempt Purpose, Scientific  \\nOrganizations,  IRC 501(c)(3) . \\nH.14.  Serving Public Interests  \\n(1) An organization isn???t operated exclusively for exempt purposes if its net earnings inure in whole or in part to the benefit of private shareholders or individuals. In other w ords, if an organization furthers private rather than public \\ninterests, it won???t meet the operational test.  \\n(2) For example, an organization may not be operated for the benefit of private shareholders or individuals . See Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(c)(2).  \\na. In Wendy L. Parker Rehabilitation Foundation, Inc. v. CIR, T.C. Memo.  \\n1986- 348, the court upheld denial of exemption under Section 501(c)(3) \\nbased on inurement. The foundation planned to distribute thirty percent of funds for the care of Wendy Parker (daughter and sister of organization directors/officers). As the distribution of funds for the benefit of Wendy Parker assisted the Parker family in providing for her care, the organization was serving the private interests of the individuals who created it.  \\n(3) Inurement results when an insider (an individual in a relationship with the organization) uses  their position to use the organization???s income or assets for \\npersonal gain.  \\n(4) Private benefit , a term broader than inurement, includes inurement but also \\nresults  when a substantial benefit accrues to an independent outsider.  -23-   (5) The burden of proof is on an organization to establish that it isn???t organized or \\noperated for the benefit of private interests. Therefore, when applying for exemption, an organization must  provide the IRS with documents stating its \\npurposes , rules of oper ation, and a detailed explanation of its operations. See \\nRev. Proc. 2023 -5, 2023- 1 I.R.B. 265 (as updated annually).  \\nII. Adverse Actions and Activities  \\n(1) Adverse actions and activities will be discussed briefly in the following sections.  \\nA. Inurement  \\n(1) For inurement  to exist, an ???insider??? must receive financial gain because of their \\nposition within the exempt organization. Insiders  generally include , but are not \\nlimited to the following:   \\na. Trustees  \\nb. Board members  \\nc. Officers  \\nd. Members  \\ne. Founders  \\nf. Significant donors  \\ng. Emplo yees  \\nh. Individuals with a close professional working relationship with the exempt organization \\n(2) Inurement may exist in many forms. Some examples are:  \\na. Unreasonable compensation  \\nb. Payment of excessive rent  \\nc. Detained or retained interests  \\nd. Receipt  (by the exempt  organization)  of less than fair market values in \\nsales or exchange property  \\ne. Unsecured or inadequately secured loans  \\nf. Prohibitive benefit from funds  \\ng. Exempt organizations providing capital improvements to property  owned \\nby its insiders  \\nh. Copyrights and royalties benefiting insiders  \\ni. Interest free and/or unsecured loans to insiders  \\nj. Dividends  \\n(3) An organization won???t qualify for exemption under Section 501(c)(3) even if a minimal amount of inurement exists because it ser ves private rather than public -24-   purposes and therefore more than an insubstantial part of its activities aren???t in \\nfurtherance of an exempt purpose.  \\n(4) See Technical Guide, TG 3- 8: Disqualifying and Non- Exempt Activities, \\nInurement and Private Benefit IRC 501(c)(3 ), and Technical Guide, TG 3- 65: \\nExcess Benefit Transaction Excise Tax ???  IRC 4958.  (Note: TG 3 -8 will be \\npublished in the future. ) \\nB. Private Benefit  \\n(1) The terms inurement and private benefit are not interchangeable.  \\n(2) Private benefit is broader than inurem ent. All inurement is private benefit but not \\nall private benefit is inurement.  \\n(3) Treas. Reg. 1.501 (c)(3) -1(d)(1)(ii) states that an organization isn???t organized or \\noperated exclusively for exempt purposes unless it serves a public rather than a private interest.  \\n(4) Private benefit will not preclude exemption if it is incidental  to the \\naccomplishment of exempt purposes. However, an activity that primarily serves private interests may jeopardize exempt status if it???s carried on to a degree that???s more than an insubstantial part of the organization???s activities.  \\n(5) To be incidental, private benefit:  \\na. Must be a necessary by -product of the activity that benefits the public at \\nlarge and accomplishes exempt purposes. The benefit to the public can???t be achieved without necessarily benefitting certain private individuals.  \\nSee Rev. Rul. 70- 186, 1970- 1 CB 128, where the organization???s \\npreserv ation of a lake as a public recreational facility was impossible to \\naccomplish without providing benefit to certain private property owners.  \\nb. Must not be substantial relative to the public benefit  the organization \\nprovides . This is a facts and circumstances test that requires public benefit \\nfrom the organization???s activities  to outweigh any individual benefit.  \\nSee Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(d)(1)(iii), Example 2, where the benefit to \\nnoncharitable beneficiaries wasn??? t incidental.  \\n(6) For detail , see Technical G uide, TG 3- 8, Disqualifying and Non- Exempt \\nActivities, Inurement and Private Benefit IRC 501(c)(3).  \\n(Note:  TG 3 -8 will be published in the future.

Legislative and Lobbying Activity  \\n(1) An organization w on???t qualify for exemption under Section 501(c)(3) if a \\nsubstantial  part of its activities is attempting to influence legislation (also \\nknown as lobbying) . A Section  501(c)(3) organization may engage in some \\nlobbying, but too much of this activity will result in a denial of exemption or revocation of tax -exempt status.  -25-   (2) Whether an organization???s attempts to influence legislation (lobbying) constitute \\na ???substantial???  part of its overall activities is based on one of two tests.  \\na. The first test is determined based on all of the pertinent facts and \\ncircumstances in each case. G enerally, less than five percent of activities \\nand expenditures is considered insubstantial.  See Seasongood v. Comm\\'r , \\n227 F.2d 907 (6th Cir. 1955) . \\nb. The second test is based on expenditures only;  however, an organization \\nmust elect to be covered by this test . See Section 501(h) and Form 5768, \\nElection/Revocation of Election by an Eligible IRC Section 501(c)(3) Organization \\nto Make Expenditures to Influence Legislation.  \\n(3) Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(c)(3)(ii)(b) define s legislation as including action by \\nCongress, by any state legislature, by any local council or similar governing body, or by the public in a referendum, initiative, constitutional amendment, or similar procedure. \\n(4) Legislation does n???t incl ude the actions of all legislative type bodies. Treas. Reg. \\n56.4911- 2(d)(3) and (4) provide that legislation doesn??? t include actions by:  \\na. Executive, judicial or administrative bodies  \\nb. School boards  \\nc. Housing authorities  \\nd. Sewer and water districts  \\ne. Zoning boards  \\nf. Other similar federal, state, or local special purpose bodies, whether elective or appointive  \\n(5) Lobbying includes direct communications  (direct lobbying)  to legislative \\nmembers and indirect communications (grassroots lobbying) to legislative members through the electorate or general public.  \\n(6) The term ???influencing legislation??? is defined as: \\na. Any attempt to influence legislation through an attempt to affect the opinions  of the general public  \\nb. Any attempt to influence legislation by communication with a member or employee of a legislative body or with a government official or employee who can participate in formulation of legislation ( Section 4911(d)(1) ).  \\n(7) Section 4911(d)((2) describes activities that aren???t considered influencing legislation . These include: \\na. Making available the results of nonpartisan analysis, study, or research \\nb. Providing technical advice or assistance to a governmental body, committee, or subdivision in response to its written request  -26-   c. Making appearances before any legislative body or communi cations with it \\nregarding a possible decision by the body that might affect the exempt \\norganization \\nd. Communicating with its members regarding legislation or proposed \\nlegislation of direct interest to the members  \\ne. Communicating with a government official or employee who is not connected with a legislative body.   \\n(8) An ???action organization???  can???t qualify under Section 501(c)(3). An organization \\nis an ???action organization??? if : \\na. Its main or primary objective is gained only by legislation or a defeat of \\nproposed legis lation, and \\nb. It advocates or campaigns for attainment of its primary objective as \\ndistinguished from  engaging in nonpartisan analysis, study or research \\nand making those results available to the public.  \\na. All facts and circumstances should be considered when making a \\ndetermination. See Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(c)(3)(iv).  \\n(9) Section 501(h) permits certain eligible S ection 501(c)(3) organizations to elect \\nto make limited expenditures to influence legislation.  \\na. Form 5768 must be filed to make an election and revoke an election.  \\nb. An electing organization that spends more than the amounts permitted \\nunder Section 501(h) is subject to an excise tax under S ection 4911.  \\nc. Loss of tax -exempt status can occur if lobbying expenditures exceed the \\npermitted amounts by more than 50% over a 4- year period.  \\n(10)  For detail  see Technical  Guide,  TG 3-9: Disqualifying and Non- Exempt \\nActivities, Political and Lobbying Activities IRC 501(c)(3) . (Note : TG 3 -9 will be \\npublished in the future. For a list of all TGs published and in process, see the cumulative list of Technical Guides located in TG 0 Technical Guides Overview, Exhibit III, starting on page 10.)  \\nD. Political Activity Prohibited  \\n(1) Section 501(c)(3) organizations are prohibited from directly or indirectly \\nparticipating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office.  \\n(2) Contributions to political campaigns or public statements of position (verbal or written) made on behalf of the organization in favor of or in opposition to any candidate for public office violate the prohibition against political campaign activity under S ection 501(c)(3). Violating this prohibition will result in denial of \\nexemption or revocation of tax -exempt status and the imposition of certain \\nexcise taxes.  \\n(3) While some activities and disbursements are obviously polit ical in nature, others \\nmay seem to be political but are actually educational  when conducted in a non --27-   partisan manner . Examples of this include certain voter education activities , \\npresenting public forums , publishing voter education guides, voter registrati on \\nand get -out-the-vote drives.  \\n(4) For detail  see Technical  Guide, TG 3- 9: Disqualifying and Non- Exempt \\nActivities, Political and Lobbying Activities IRC 501(c)(3) . (TG 3 -9 will be \\npublished in the future. For a list of all TGs published and in process, see t he \\ncumulative list of Technical Guides located in TG 0 Technical Guides Overview, \\nExhibit III, starting on page 10.)  \\nE. Carrying on a Trade or Business  \\n(1) For purposes of this section, the following terms are defined:  \\na. Trade or business -  same meaning as it has i n Section 162, and generally \\nincludes any activity carried on for the production of income via the sale of goods or performance of services. See Treas. Reg. 1.513- 1(b). \\nb. Unrelated trade or business -  a trade or business regularly conducted by \\nan exempt organization that is  not substantially related (aside from the \\nneed of such organization for income or funds or the use it makes of the profits derived) to the performance by such organization of its exempt purpose. See Section 513. This definition applies to any organization subject to the tax imposed by Section  511 on unrelated business income.  \\n(2) An organization may meet the requirements of Section 501(c)(3) even though it operates a trade or business as a substantial part of its activities, as long as the operation of such trade or business furthers the organization\\'s exempt purpose(s), and the organization isn???t organized or operated for the primary purpose of carrying on an unrelated trade or business. See Treas. Reg. \\n1.501(c)(3) ???1(e)(1).  \\n(3) The purposes toward which an organization???s activities are directed, and not the nature of the activities will determine whether an organization operating a trade or business can meet the requirements of Section 501(c)(3). See B.S.W. Group, Inc. v. Commissioner, 70 T.C. 352 (1978).  \\n(4) Determining whether an activity serves an exempt purpose while carrying on a trade or business requires considering all the facts and circumstances. The followin g factors are especially important:  \\na. The way the activities are conducted \\nb. The degree the activities are carried on with a \"commercial hue\"  \\nc. Competition with commercial firms  \\nd. The existence and amount of annual or accumulated profits  \\ne. How the organization sets its prices or fees (are they at or below cost, or  \\nat a substantial markup).  \\nSee Living Faith, Inc. v. Commissioner, 950 F.2d 365 (7th Cir. 1991);  Airlie \\nFoundation v. IRS, 283 F.Supp.2d\\n 58 (D.D.C., 2003) . -28-   (5) An organization doesn???t qualify for exemption if an activity serves a substantial \\nnon-exempt purpose. This is true even if  the activity may also further an exempt \\npurpose. For example:  \\nIn Schoger Foundation v. Commissioner, 76 T.C. 380 (1981) , a not -for-profit \\ncorporation was formed to own and operate a mountain lodge as a religious \\nretreat facility. The lodge mad e available to its guests???  numerous activities - \\nreligious, recreational, and social . None of the activities  were  regularly \\nscheduled or required. The religious activities revolved  around individual prayer \\nand contemplation, with optional daily devotions and occasional Sunday \\nservices. The recreational and social activities were of the type usually offered at  \\nvacation resort s. No records were kept showing participation by guests in any of \\nthe activities.  The court held that the organization failed to establish that it was \\noperated exclusively for religious or other exempt purposes within the meaning \\nof Section  501(c) (3). \\n(6) Unrelated trade or business doesn???t include any trade or business:  \\na. In which substantially all the work in carrying on such trade or business is performed for the organization without compensation (volunteer labor \\nexception).  \\nb. Which is carried on (in the case of an organization described in Section 501(c)(3)  or college/ university described in IRC 511(a)(2)(B)), by the \\norganization primarily for the convenience of its members, students, patients, officers, or employees  (cafeteria, campus bookstore, campus \\nhealth clinic) .  \\nc. Which is the selling of merchandise, substantially  all of which has been \\nreceived by the organization as gifts or contributions  (such as thrift stores).   \\nSee Section 513(a) (1)-(3). \\n(7) An organization operated for the primary purpose of carrying on a trade or business shall not be exempt on the ground that al l of its profits are payable to \\nan exempt organization. See Section 502, Feeder Organizations.  \\n(8) For detail s on this subject,  see Technical Guide, TG  48, Unrelated Trade or \\nBusiness and Taxation of Unrelated Business Income.  (Note : TG 48 will be \\npublished in the future. For a list of all TGs published and in process, see the \\ncumulative list of Technical Guides located in TG 0 Technical Guides Overview, Exhibit III, starting on page 10.)  \\nIII. Other Considerations  \\n(1) A number of factors should be considered by organizations applying for tax -\\nexempt status  under Section 501(c)(3) . Some factors concern the application \\nprocess . Others are the organization???s operational responsibilities should tax -\\nexemption be granted.  \\n \\n -29-   A. Foundation  Status \\n(1) Every organization that qualifies for tax -exempt status under Section 501(c)(3) \\nis further classified as either a public charity or a private foundation.  \\n(2) A Section 501(c)(3) organization is generally presumed to be a private \\nfoundation unless  it files a t imely notice to the contrary with the IRS. See \\nSection 508(b) . \\n(3) An organization gives  notice by timely filing a properly completed Form 1023, \\nApplication for Recognition of Exemption Under Section 501(c)(3) of the IRC , or \\nif eligible a Form 1023- EZ, Streaml ined Application for Recognition of \\nExemption Under Section 501(c)(3) of the IRC . Note:  A few types of \\norganizations described in Section 501(c)(3) are excepted from the requirement \\nto file an application. See IRC 508(c).  \\n(4) Section 509(a) defines the term ???private foundation??? to mean any domestic or \\nforeign organization described in Section 501(c)(3) other than an organization \\ndescribed in Section  509(a)(1), (2), (3), or (4). Thus, if an organization is \\ndescribed in S ection 501(c)(3), it is a private foundation (PF) unless it falls into \\none of four general categories of organizations excluded under S ections \\n509(a)(1) through (4) . \\n(5) The following chart lists the categories of organizations excluded from private foundation status  and their  applicable technical guides:  \\nFoundation Status  Internal R evenue Code  Technical Guide * \\nChurch or convention or \\nassociation of churches  509(a)(1) & 170(b)(1)(A)(i)  TG 3 -23: Foundation Status, \\nChurch, IRC 501(c)(3)  \\nSchool  509(a)(1) & 170(b)(1)(A)(ii)  TG 3 -24: Foundation Status, \\nSchool , IRC 501(c)(3)  \\nHospital, cooperative hospital \\nservice organization or a \\nmedical research \\norganization (part of hospital ) 509(a)(1) & 170(b)(1)(A)(iii)  TG 3 -25: Foundation \\nClassification, Hosp ital, IRC \\n501(c)(3)  \\nOrganization operated for the \\nbenefit of a college or \\nuniversity - owned or operated \\nby a governmental unit  509(a)(1) & 170(b)(1)(A)(iv)  TG 3 -27: Foundation Status, \\nOther Non -Private \\nFoundation IRC 509(a)(1) \\nand IRC 170(b)(1)(A)(iv), (v), \\n(ix); and 509(a)(4), IRC \\n501(c)(3)  \\nA governmental unit  \\n 509(a)(1) and 170(b)(1)(A)(v)  \\nNote:  EO Determinations \\ndoes not issue rulings under this section.  \\nSee Rev.

Reg.  1.509(a) -1 through 1.509(a) -6 \\nc. IRM 7.20.3, Processing Foundation Classification and Miscellaneous \\nRequests.  \\nB. Employment Tax Requirements  \\n(1) Every employer, including an organization exempt from federal income tax that pays wages to employees is responsible for withholding, depositing, paying, and reporting federal income tax, social security and Medicare (FICA) taxes, and federal unemployment tax (FUTA), unle ss that employer is specifically \\nexcepted by law from those requirements, or if the taxes clearly don\\'t apply.  \\n(2) See Section V.B. 4., Employment Tax Obligations  of this TG . \\nC. Deductibility of Contributions  \\n(1) Organizations described in Section 501(c)(3), other than testing for public safety \\norganizations, are eligible to receive tax -deductible contributions under Section \\n170. \\nC.1. Charitable Contributions ???  Section 170 \\n(1) Section  170(c)(2) defines ???charitable contribution??? as a contribution or gift to or \\nfor the use of:   \\n(2) A corporation, trust, or community chest, fund, or foundation  \\na. Created or organized in the United States or in any possession thereof, or \\nunder the law of the Unit ed States, any State, the District of Columbia, or \\nany possession of the United States  \\nb. Organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, \\nliterary, or educational purposes, or to foster national or international amateur sports compet ition (but only if no part of its activities involve the \\nprovision of athletic facilities or equipment), or for the prevention of cruelty to children or animals  \\nc. No part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private \\nshareholder or indivi dual, and \\nd. Which isn ???t disqualified for tax exemption under  Section  501(c)(3) by \\nreason of attempting to influence legislation, and which doesn??? t participate \\nin, or intervene in (including the publishing or distributing of statements), any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office.  \\n(3) A contribution or gift by a corporation to a trust, chest, fund, or foundation shall be deductible only  if it???s to be used within the U .S. or any of its possessions -32-   exclusively for purposes specified in Section  170(c)(2)(B). Rules similar to the \\nrules of Section  501(j) shall apply for purposes of this paragraph.   \\n(4) For purposes of Section  170, the term ???charitable contribution??? also means an \\namount treated under Section  170(g), amounts paid to maintain certain \\nstudents as members of taxpayer???s household, as paid for the use of an \\norganization described in Section  170(c)(2), (3), or (4).  \\n(5) A determination letter  or ruling recognizing the exemption of an organization \\nunder Section 501(c)(3) should indicate if the organization is eligible to receive \\ndeductible charitable contributions. For example, an entity organized outside the U.S.,  or its te rritories or possessions isn???t described in Section IRC 170(c) . \\nTherefore, generally the determination letter  for foreign organizations  should \\nindicate that charitable contributions  are not deductible.  \\n(6) Note:  A contribution may be deductible  if provided for by a tax treaty. \\nCurrently, Canada is the only country with a fully implemented tax treat y with \\nthe United States . See United States ???Canada Income Tax Convention, 1986-\\n2 C.B. 258 and Notice 99- 47, 1999- 2 C.B. 391.  \\nC.2. Churches & Section 170 Deductibility  \\n(1) Churches, like many other charitable organizations, qualify for exemption from \\nfederal income tax under Section  501(c)(3) and are generally eligible to \\nreceive tax -deductible contributions  under  Section 170(c)(2).  \\n(2) Churches , however,  are not required to apply for and obtain recognition of tax -\\nexempt status from the IRS. As described below, c hurches that meet the \\nrequirements for Section 501(c)(3) are automatically considered tax -exempt . \\n(3) If a churc h organization wants  recognition of exemption from federal income \\ntax and l isted  in the Pub 78 data as an entity entitled to  receive tax deductible \\ncontributions, it may file an application for exemption.  \\n(4) Under Section 508(a) , an organization organized after October 9, 1969 \\n(except for organizations noted in Section 508(c)), shall not be treated as \\ndescribed in Section  501(c)(3) unless it has given notice to the Service by \\nfiling a properly completed and executed exemption application for recognition \\nof Section  501(c)(3) status. See Treas. Reg. 1.508??? 1(a)(2)(i).   \\n(5) Certain organizations exempt under Section 501(c)(3) are excepted from the \\nSection  508(a) notice requirements:  \\na. Churches, their integrated auxiliaries, and conventions or associations of churches  \\nb. Organizations that normally have gross receipts not in excess of $5,000, and are not private foundations  \\nc. Subordinate organizations (other than private foundations) covered by a group exemption letter . -33-   C.3. Foreign Organizations & Section 170 Deductibility  \\n(1) Accor ding to Section 170(c)(2), c haritable contributions by donors  to \\norganizations formed either outside the U.S. or under foreign law  are not \\ndeductible.  Canada has a fully implemented tax treaty with the United States.) \\nUnited States ???Canada Income Tax Convention, 1986- 2 C.B. 258  and Notice \\n99-47, 1999- 2 C.B. 391.  \\n(2) Under certain tax treaties, contributions to foreign organizations may be \\ndeductible to a limited extent . Generally, tax treaties limit deductibility to the \\napplicable percentage of the taxpayer???s income derived from the treaty -\\npartner.  \\n(3) A contribution to a charitable organization in a country with a fully implemented tax treaty may be claimed as a charitable deduction to the extent allowed by \\nthe treaty , even though the organization hasn??? t applied for recognition of \\nexemption in the U .S. Canada is currently the only country with a fully \\nimplemented tax treaty with the U.S.  See Notice 99- 47, 1999- 2 C.B. 391.  \\n(4) An organization in a country that has a tax treaty that is not fully implemented through a competent authority agreement can receive deductible contributions to the extent allowed by the particular treaty if it establishes its exempt status with the IRS.  \\n(5) Contributions to charitable organizations formed in U.S. territories are deductible by donors. See IRC 170(c)(2).  \\nC.4. Contributions to Dome stic Organizations with Foreign \\nActivities \\n(1) If a domestic organization transmits its funds to a foreign private organization but retains the requisite control and discretion over the funds , it qualifies for \\nrecognition of exemption under Section 501(c)(3) . Contributions to it will be \\ndeductible under Section 170(c)(2).  See Example 4 or Example 5 of Rev. Rul. \\n63-252, 1963- 2 C.B. 101 and Rev. Rul. 66 -79, 1966- 1 C.B. 48.  \\n(2) However, if a domestic organization, otherwise qualified under Section \\n501(c)(3), transmits  its funds to a private organization not described in Section \\n501(c)(3) and fails to exercise, or has too little, discretion and control over the use of such funds , the domestic organization forfeits its qualification for \\nexempt status because it can???t dem onstrate that it???s operated exclusively for \\ncharitable purposes . The contributions to it aren???t deductible.  \\nD. Other Benefits of Tax Exemption  \\n(1) In addition to exemption from the payment of federal income tax and the general deductibility of charitable contributions, Section 501(c)(3)  organizations  \\nmay enjoy other benefits under the IRC, as well as under state or local income, property, sales, use, or other tax provisions.  -34-   D.1. State, Local, Employment and Excise Tax Benefits  \\n(1) Many state and local jurisdictions accept the IRS???s determination for their own \\nexemption requirements or require exemption from federal income tax under Section 501(c)(3) as a prerequisite to granting exemption under state or local provisions.  \\na. To promote efficient enforcement of separate tax laws, Section 6104(c) \\nprovides an exception to the general confidentiality provisions of Section 6103. The exception allows the Service to share information with \\nappropriate state officials including in situations where  organizations have \\nbeen denied recognition of exemption under Section 501(c)(3) or have had their exemption under Section 501(c)(3) revoked.  \\nb. Some organizations may also enjoy exemption from certain federal excise taxes (for example, telephone excise tax ). \\nD.2. Other Benefits  \\n(1) Religious, educational, scientific, and philanthropic (charitable) organizations \\nare eligible to mail at preferred postal rates. However,  not all Section 501(c)(3) \\norganizations are eligible. Qualifying organizations must apply to the Uni ted \\nStates Postal Service for consideration of these preferred rates.  See USPS, \\nPublication 417, Nonprofit USPS Marketing Mail Eligibility : Nonprofit and Other \\nQualified Organizations.  \\n(2) Section 501(c)(3)  organizations  can offer their employees the benefit of \\nspecial annuity tax provisions under Section 403(b).  \\n(3) Section 501(c) organizations can offer their  employees qualified Section \\n457(b)  deferred compensation plans. Note: Churches and qualified church-\\ncontrolled organizations as defined in Section 3121(w) (A) and (B)  are not \\neligible employers. See Treas. Reg. 1.457- 2(e). \\n(4) Exempt organizations can also maintain qualified Section 401(k) plans and adopt qualified profit -sharing plans under Section 401(a)(27) for their \\nemployees.  \\nE. Interaction with Section 4958  \\n(1) Section  4958 imposes  excise taxes on persons engaging in excess benefit \\ntransactions with an applicable tax -exempt organization.  Those taxes include:  \\na. A tax equal to 25 percent of the excess benefit on a disqualified person \\nwho engages in excess benefit transactions with an applicable tax -exempt \\norganization. See Section 4958(a)(1).  \\nb. A tax equal to 10 percent  of the excess benefit on the participation of any \\norganization manager involved in the excess benefit transaction unless participation is not willful and is due to reasonable cause.  See Section \\n4958(a)(2).  -35-   c. An additional tax equal to 200 percent  on the dis qualified person if the \\nexcess benefit involved in the transaction at issue is not corrected within \\nthe taxable period.  See Section 4958(b).  \\n(2) An ???excess benefit transaction??? means any transaction in which an:                 \\na. Economic benefit is provided by an applicable tax -exempt organization \\ndirectly or indirectly to or for the use of any disqualified person, and  \\nb. The value of the e conomic benefit provided exceeds the value of the \\nconsideration (including the performance of services) received for providing the benefit . See Section 4958(c)(1).  \\n(3) Section 4958(f)(1) defines disqualified person as:  \\na. Any person who was in a position to exercise substantial influence over \\nthe affairs of the organization, at any time during the 5- year period ending \\non the date of the transaction (look -back period)  \\nb. A person involved with a related 509(a)(3) supporting organization  \\nc. A person involved in a transaction with a donor advised fund \\nd. A member of a disqualified person???s family  \\ne. A 35-percent controlled entity . \\n(4) Section 4958 imposes penalties on the offending individuals (disqualified \\npersons, organizational managers) rather than on the exempt organization \\nitself. \\n(5) However, Section 4958 need not be the only sanction imposed on an excess benefit transaction. An organization???s ex empt status may still be subject to \\nrevocation, for instance, if appropriate.  \\nF. Financial Support Provided to  Other Organizations  \\n(1) Many charitable organizations don???t engage in active charitable undertakings \\nthemselves . Instead, they assist the work of religious, charitable, educational, or \\nsimilar organizations by contributing money to them through grantmaking, indirect support, and support through nonexempt organizations. For example:  \\na. Grantmaking organizations are sometimes controlled by corporate and individual taxpayers who use them as channels for their charitable \\ncontributions. Some have very large endowments and make grants totaling millions of dollars annually.  \\nSee Rev. Rul. 67- 149, 1967- 1 C.B. 133.  \\nb. An organization formed to construct and maintain a building to house member agencies of a community chest may be providing a form of indirect support of charitable activities.  \\nSee Rev. Rul. 69- 572, 1969- 2 C.B. 119.  \\nc. Some charitable organizations make distributions to nonexempt organizations. These funds must  be used for specific projects that further -36-   the purposes of the charitable organization. The charitable organization \\nmust retain discretion and control over the use of the funds and maintain records establishing that the funds are used for charitable purposes.  \\nSee Rev. Rul. 68- 489, 1968- 2 C.B. 210.  \\n(2) Exempt organizations described in Section 501(c)  other than those described in \\nSection 501(c)(3), often engage in a limited amount of charitable activities in addition to their program activity. A Section 501(c)( 3) may support the non-\\nSection 501(c)(3) charitable activities by providing funding or goods to carry  out \\nthose charitable activities as long as control and documentation of the use for charitable purposes can be secured. A Section 501(c)(3) organization, however, \\nshould be cautious when supporting the charitable activities of non- Section \\n501(c)(3)  organization s as to not jeopardize its  own tax-exempt status.  \\nG. Government Instrumentalities  \\n(1) There is no provision in the IRC that imposes a tax on the income of \\ngovernmental units. The term ???governmental units??? refers to the states and their political subdivisions. The income of governmental units  isn???t generally subject \\nto federal income taxation. See Section 115.  \\n(2) The income of a separately organized entity that is n???t an integral part of a state \\ngovernment or a political subdivision is subject to tax, unless an  exemption or \\nan exclusion applies. These organizations are referred to as ???instrumentalities.???  \\n(3) The term ???instr umentality??? of a governmental unit doesn??? t appear in Section 501. \\nIt is, however, referenced in the IRC applying the FICA and FUTA employment \\ntaxes  under Section 3126.  \\n(4) In addition to the other requirements for Section 501(c)(3), an instrumentality must sat isfy both of the following to qualify under Section 501(c)(3):  \\na. A separate organization requirement  \\nb. No sovereign powers requirement , which are police, tax, eminent domain.   \\nSee Rev. Rul. 60- 384, 1960- 2 C.B. 172.  \\nG.1.  Separate Organization Requirement \\n(1) The separate organization requirement is generally met if the entity is incorporated under state non- profit corporation law.  A corporation is a legal \\nentity, created under the authority of the laws of a state, which is regarded as having an existence completely separate and apart from that of its creators and constituents.  \\n(2) A trust is also a separate organization.  A trust is defined as: \\nAn arrangement created either by a will or by an inter -vivos \\ndeclaration where trustees take title to property to protect or conserve it for the beneficiaries under the ordinary rules applied in chancery or probate courts. An arrangement will be treated as a trust if it can be shown that the purpose is to vest in trustees???\\n responsibility  for the \\nprotection and conservation of property for beneficiaries who cannot -37-   share in the discharge of this responsibility and, therefore, are not \\nassociates in a joint enterprise for the conduct of business for profit.  \\nSee Treas. Reg. 301.7701- 4(a).  \\n(3) Section 7701(a)(3) states that the term ???corporation??? includes associations. \\nThus, an association may be considered a corporation for federal tax purposes (as determined under Treas. Reg. 301.7701- 3). Any entity that ???s a \\n???corporation??? for federal tax law purposes will be considered separately organized, even if it is not incorporated under state law.  \\n(4) An organization established pursuant to a state statute, satisfies the \\norganizational requirements of Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(b) by s ufficiently \\ndescribing its operations  (stated purposes) . See 1996 EO CPE F. State \\nInstitutions ??? Instrumentalities. ???[I]f a careful reading of an instrumentality???s \\nenabling document clearly shows that it will operate exclusively for exempt purposes, it will be deemed to have met that por tion of the organizational test.???  \\n(5) A business entity wholly owned by a State or any political subdivision, or a \\nbusiness entity wholly owned by a foreign government,  or any other entity \\ndescribed in Treas. R eg. 1.892- 2T is treated as a corporation. See Treas. \\nReg. 301.7701- 2(b)(6).  \\n(6) Entities considered ???separately organized??? include colleges and universities , \\nhospital s, housing, or development authorities , public library boards , water or \\npark districts , public s chool athletic as sociations , charitable trusts , and \\norganizations created by inter -governmental agreement.   \\nG.2. Powers Other than those Described in Section 501(c)(3)  \\n(1) An instrumentality that exercises substantial regulatory or enforcement powers \\nin the public interest  (such as health, welfare, or safety),  won???t  qualify  for \\nexemption.  \\n(2) Powers of regulation or enforcement are powers which are possessed by governmental agencies such as school boards  and boards of health and \\nwelfare. These powers are referred to as  sovereign powers.  \\n(3) There are three generally acknowledged sovereign powers : \\na. Police power  \\nb. Power to tax  \\nc. Power of eminent domain.  \\n(4) The presence of either the police power or the power to tax, if substantial, will  \\ndisqualify a separately  organized government entity from exemption under \\nSection 501(c)(3).  See Rev. Rul. 60 -384, 1960- 2 C.B. 172.  \\n(5) Also, a n organization having investigatory powers which are regulatory  or \\nenforcement powers of the kind referred to in Rev. Rul. 60- 384, won???t qualify \\nfor exemption. See Rev. Rul. 74 -14, 1974- 1 C.B. 125.  -38-   (6) There is no distinction between the power to recommend or certify a tax rate, \\nthe power to determine a tax rate, and the power to levy, assess, or impose a tax. The regulatory or  enforcement power lies with the power to collect  - not \\nthe power to certify or levy a tax rate. Thus, if an organization has the power to collect tax, it  won???t qualify for exemption.  \\n(7) Organizations without substantial sovereign powers won???t be disqualified from exemption since they don???t  indicate purposes beyond those qualifying as \\nexclusively exempt under Section 501(c)(3).  Organizations with insubstantial \\nsovereign powers are not disqualified from exemption. For example, a state university with a police force that regulates traffic, mot or vehicles and speed \\nlimits on campus, issues citations, imposes fines and arrests persons to detain them until city police arrives, is not disqualified from exemption because its police powers are insubstantial and limited to its campus. See Rev. Rul. 77-165, 1977- 1 C.B. 21.  \\n(8) Although the power of eminent domain is clearly  a sovereign power, it is not \\nnecessarily a power of regulation or enforcement within the meaning of Rev. Rul. 60 -384 and may not disqualify a separately organized government entity \\nfrom exemption. See Rev. Rul. 67 -290, 1967- 2 C.B. 183.  \\n(9) If the power of eminent domain is combined with other powers to give an organization purpose broader than those described in Section 501(c)(3), then \\nthe organization does n???t qualify for exemption. For example, if an organization, \\nin addition to condemning property by the power of eminent domain, has the power to conduct investigations, hear testimony and take proof under oath, issue subpoenas, and recommend standards of maintenance and \\nrequirements of applic able health and safety ordinances and zoning, it does n???t \\nqualify.  \\nG.3. Dissolution Provisions  \\n(1) Many instrumentalities have language in their governing instrument providing that upon dissolution, all remaining assets will be distributed to a state or any politica l subdivision thereof to satisfy Section 115 requirements. This raises a \\npotential problem, as Treas. Reg. Section 1.501(c)(3) -1(b)(4) requires that \\nupon dissolution assets be distributed to the Federal government, or to a State or local government, for a public purpose.  \\n(2) However, if the organization has been created by a state statute, local ordinance, or similar enabling vehicle, and there is no indication that upon dissolution the assets will be distributed for private use, then it can be considered to s atisfy the dissolution requirements without explicitly including \\nthe phrase ???for a public purpose,??? which would normally be required.  \\nG.4. Section 115 Exclusion  \\n(1) Section 115(1) states,  ???gross income does not include income derived from \\nany public utility or the exercise of any essential governmental function and accruing to a State or any political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia.???  -39-   (2) Activities that involve exercise of an ???essential government function??? for \\nSection 115 purposes are generally determined on a case- by-case basis. \\nSome factors to consider whether an activity is considered governmental include the involvement of sovereign powers, the extent of governmental control over the activity, and the extent of governmental financial interest i n the \\nactivity.  \\n(3) In order for a government entity to receive a determination of its status as a political subdivision, instrumentality of government, or whether its revenue is excluded under Section 115, it must obtain a letter ruling by following the \\nprocedures specified in Revenue Procedure 2023- 1, 2023 -1 I.R.B. 1  (updated \\nannually) . There is a user fee for obtaining a letter ruling.  \\n(4) The fact that an organization???s income may be excluded under Section 115(1) does n???t preclude it from also qualifying for ex emption under Section 501(c)(3).  \\nH. Native American Tribal Governments \\n(1) Before 1983, Native American governments were not tr eated similarly to state \\nor local governments under the IRC . Although tribal governments weren??? t \\nsubject to tax (Rev. Rul. 67- 284, 1967- 2 C.B. 55), the favorable consequences \\navailable to private parties entering into transactions with state governments didn???t apply to similar transactions with Native American tribal governments.  \\n(2) Congress sought to equalize this treatment by enacting Sect ions 7701(a)(40) \\nand 7871 which  provides that for certain specified federal tax purposes, an \\nIndian tribal government shall be treated as a State.  \\nH.1. Terms Defined for Native American Tribal Governments   \\n(1) Indian tribal government  - the governing body of any tribe, band, community, \\nvillage, or group of Indians, or (if applicable) Alaska Natives, which is determined by the Secretary, after consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, to exercise governmental functions.  Section 7701(a)(40)(A) .  \\n(2) Governmental function - not defined under Section 7701(a)(40) or Section \\n7871, but legislative history shows  that Congress considered the term  \\n???governmental function??? to be synonymous  with the term ???sovereign powers.??? \\nIn addition, Treas. Reg. ?? 305.7871- 1(d) defines the term ???essential \\ngovernmental function??? for purposes of section 7871 as a function of a type which is  \\na. Eligible for funding under 25 U.S.C. Section  13 (relating to expenditures \\nby the Bureau of Indian Affairs)  \\nb. Eligible for grants or contracts under 25 U.S.C. 450(f), (g), and (h), or  \\nc. An essential governmental function under section 115  \\n(3) Political subdivision ???  not defined under Section 7701(a)(40) or Section 7871, \\nbut legislative history indicates that the determination of an entity???s status as a \\npolitical subdivision of an Indian tribal government is to be based on the same -40-   criteria as has traditionally been applied to determine an entity???s status as a \\npolitical subdivision of a state under Section 103.  \\nFor purposes specified in Section 7871(a), a subdivision of an Indian tribal \\ngovernment shall be treated as a political subdivision of a state if (and only if) the Secretary of the Treasury determines (after consultation with the Secretary of the Interior) that such subdivision has been delegated the right to exercise one or more of the substantial governmental functions of the Indian tribal government.  Section 7871(d) . \\nTreas. Reg. 1. 103-1(b) defines a political subdivision as any division of any \\nstate or local government unit which is a municipal corporation, or which has been delegated the right to exercise part of the sovereign power of the unit.  \\nH.2. Recognized Tribal Entities and Subdivisions \\n(1) Indian tribal entities recognized as Indian tribal governments and subdivisions of Indian tribal governments r ecognized as political subdivisions aren??? t subject \\nto federal income tax on amounts derived from performing their tribal functions. This non- tax treatment is derived from the Service???s long -standing \\nposition, set forth in Rev. Rul. 67- 284, 1967- 2 C.B. 55. Under this revenue \\nruling an Indian tribal government is not a taxable entity . It won???t qualify for  \\nSection 501(c)(3) exemption. It is simply not taxed.  \\n(2) Rev. Proc. 2008- 55, 2008 2 C.B. 768, designates the entities that appear on \\nthe current or future lists  of federally recognized Indian tribes published \\nannually by the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, as Indian tribal governments for purposes of section 7701(a)(40). Indian tribal governments are treated as States for certain purposes under section 7871(a).   \\n(3) Rev. Proc. 84- 36, 1984- 1 C.B. 510,  lists the recognized subdivisions of Indian \\ntribal governments to be treated as political subdivisions of states for specified purposes under the Code for a two- year period. Subsequently, Rev. Proc. 86-\\n17, 1986- 1 C.B. 550 deleted the two- year limitation.  \\n(4) Rev. Proc.  84-37, 1984- 1 C.B. 513, as modified by Rev. Proc. 2023- 1, 2023- 1 \\nI.R.B 1  (updated annually), provides guidance on how a governmental unit of \\nan Indian tribe or a political subdivision of an Indian tribal government not included among those listed in Revenue Procedures previously published by the IRS can request a determination qualifying it for treatment as a state or a \\npolitical subdivision of a state as provided under S ection 7871.  \\nH.3. Other Indian Tribal Organizations  \\n(1) The Service has processed applications  from a variety of Native American \\nrelated organizations, including:  \\na. A tribal corporation organized under S ection 17 of the Indian \\nReorganization Act of 1934  \\nb. A separately organized entity created under state law by a tribal government  -41-   c. A separately organized entity created by a tribal government recognized \\nby a particular State but not the Federal government  \\nd. A tribal government believed to qualify for treatment as a state or a political subdivision of a state for purposes of Section 7871 and 7701(a)(40).  \\n(2) A Native American tribal corporation, organized under Section 17 of the \\nIndian Reorganization Act of 1934, 25 U.S.C. Section 477 i , is not subject to \\nfederal income tax on the income earned in the conduct of commercial business on or off the tribe\\'s reservati on. However, a corporation organized by \\nan Indian tribe under state law  is subject to federal income tax on the income \\nearned in the conduct of commercial business on and off the tribe\\'s reservation.  See Rev. Rul. 94- 16, 1994- 1 C.B. 19  \\n(3) A Native American tribal corporation, organized under Section 17 of the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, 25 U.S.C. Section 477: or under Section \\n3 of the Oklahoma Welfare Act  \\na. Doesn ???t qualify for exemption as described under Section 501(c)(3) but is \\nsimply not subject to federal income tax.   \\nb. Doesn???t owe federal income tax  regardless of the location of the business \\nactivities that produced the income (either on or off the tribe???s reservation) . \\nSee Rev. Rul s. 94- 16, 1994- 1 C.B. 19 and 94- 65, 1994- 2 C.B. 14.  \\n(4) However, a corporation organized by an Indian tribe under state law   \\na. Is subject to federal income tax on a ny income earned by such \\ncorporation, regardless of the location of the business activities that produced the income (either on or off the reservation), is subject to federal income tax . See Rev. Rul. 94- 16.  \\nb. May qualify for exemption from federal income tax if it conducts charitable \\nand educational activities as a corporation separate from the tribe. Such activities may include tribal history research, cultural activities, and self -\\nhelp projects for tribe members who are located in areas of economic blight and living on incomes below the poverty level. These charitable and educational activities are often conducted by an organization as part of  an \\neffort to be recognized as an Indian tribe by the federal government. As obtaining tribal recognition usually entails historical documentation, but not political or legislative activity, this activity won??? t disqualify an organization \\nfrom obtaining recognition under Section 501(c)(3).  \\n(5) A separately organized entity created by a tribal government that is recognized by a particular State but not the federal government may qualify for exemption from federal income tax if it otherwise meets the organizational and operational tests of Section 501(c)(3), including the absence of substantial sovereign powers.  \\n(6) If an application from a tribal entity is denied under Section 501(c)(3), but it appears that the entity will qualify for treatment as an Indian tribal government -42-   or as a political subdivision of an Indian tribal government for purposes of \\nSection 7871 and 7701(a)(40), the denial should advise that a formal \\ndetermination of status may be requested pursuant to Rev. Proc s. 84- 37, \\n1984- 1 C.B. 513 and 2023- 1, 2023 -1 I.R.B. 1 (updated annually).  \\nI. Foreign Organizations  \\n(1) Foreign organizations may  seek recognition of  exemption under Section \\n501(c)(3) even if they have no U.S. taxable income. The Service will recognize \\ntheir exempt status if they meet the same requirements applicable to domestic organizations.  \\n(2) Foreign organizations that meet the requirements of Section 501(c)(3) may \\nestablish exemption from U .S. income tax or establish their charitable status for \\npurposes of the estate and gift taxes  or other purposes . However, apart from \\ntreaty provisions, contributions to foreign charities are not deductible under Section 170(c).  \\n(3) Some foreign charitable organizations may be eligible for recognition of exemption based on a specific provision in a tax treaty their country has with the U .S. However, treaties that provide for \"reciprocal recognition\" generally \\nrequire that  the countries agree in a separate agreement that their exemption \\nstandards are comparable, or establish the scope of recognition, before the treaty takes effect.  \\n(4) Currently, Canada is the only country in which charitable organizations recognized  as exempt from income tax  by a foreign government are recognized \\nexempt under Section 501(c)(3) without applying to the Service (see United States -Canada Income Tax Convention (Treaty), Article XXI  and Notice 99- 47, \\n1999- 36 I.R.B. 392). However, Canadian charities are presumed to be private \\nfoundations and must request a determination from the IRS if they want to be considered a public charity . Canadian charities can request the public charity \\nclassification on Form 8940, Request for miscellaneous determinations. One benefit of public charity status is eligib ility for the 50 percent limit on \\ncontributions.  \\n(5) Unless excepted by provisions of a tax treaty, a foreign organization seeking recognition of exemption under Section 501(c)(3) must file an application on Form 1023, Application for Recognition of Exemption Under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code,  in the same manner as a domestic organization.  \\n(6) Organizations formed under the laws of a foreign country, or with a mailing \\naddress in a foreign country are not  eligible to file Form 1023- EZ, Streamlined \\nApplication for Recognition of Exemption Under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (See Instructions for Form 1023- EZ, Eligibility Worksheet) .  \\n(7) Contributions to charitable foreign organizations general ly are not deductible in \\ncomputing U.S. income tax. Under Section 170(c)(2)(A), charitable contributions by donors to organizations formed outside the U.S. and under foreign law aren???t deductible. However, under certain tax treaties, contributions to forei gn \\norganizations may be deductible to a limited extent. Generally, tax treaties limit -43-   deductibility to the applicable percentage of the taxpayer???s income derived from \\nthe treaty -partner.  Currently, Canada is the only country with a fully \\nimplemented tax tr eated with the United States.)  \\nIV. Application for Recognition of Exemption and Return \\nRequirements  \\n(1) Certain rules and procedures apply to organizations seeking recognition of exemption. The following will explain the procedures to obtain a determination letter recognizing an organization???s exemption under Section 501(c)(3).  \\n(2) Most exempt organizations (including private foundations) must file various returns, forms , or reports at some time during (or following the close of) their \\nfiscal year . Additionally, each organization???s state of formation has specific \\nreporting requirements . \\nA. Application for Recognition of Exemption  \\n(1) A charitable organization generally w on???t be treated as tax -exempt unless it \\napplies for recognition of exemption by filing a current application for exemption form.  \\n(2) Applications for exemption are processed by the Tax Exempt /Government \\nEntities Division, Exempt Organizations  (EO), Rulings and Agreements -\\nDeterminations.  The EO Determinations unit is responsible for reviewing \\napplications.  \\nA.1. Section 508(a) Notice \\n(1) Under Section 508(a), an organization organized after October 9, 1969 (except for organizations noted in Section 508(c)), shall not be treated as described in Section 501(c)(3) unless it has given notice to the IRS in the \\nmanner prescribed by regulations  that it???s applying for recognition of Section \\n501(c)(3) status. This is commonly referred to as the 508(a) notice.  \\n(2) Notice is given by submi tting a properly completed and executed exemption \\napplication Form 1023, Application for Recognition of Exemption Under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, or  if applicable, Form 1023-\\nEZ, Streamlined Application for Recognition of Exemption Under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code). Treas. Reg. 1.508??? 1(a)(2)(i).  \\n(3) Rev. Rul. 77 -114, 1977- 1 C.B. 152 provides that t he date of notice for \\npurposes of Code section 508(a) (the requirement to file Form 1023) is the date of the U.S. postmark st amped on the cover in which an exemption \\napplication is mailed or, if no postmark appears on the cover, the date the application is stamped as received by the Service.  Form 1023, Application for \\nRecognition of Exemption Under Section 501(c)(3) of the Inter nal Revenue \\nCode, or if applicable, Form 1023- EZ, Streamlined Application for Recognition \\nof Exemption Under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code)  are \\nsubmitted electronically. Notice is given by submitting a completed electronic application  -44-   (4) The application must be filed within 15 months  from the end of the month in \\nwhich the organization was organized. Treas. Reg. 1.508??? 1(a)(2)(i) . However, \\nan automatic 12- month extension to the 15- month period is provided by Treas. \\nReg. 301.9100??? 2(a)(2)(iv).  \\n(5) If a taxpayer fails to file an application within 27 months (filing requirement of \\n15 months plus the automatic 12- month extension), Treas. Reg. 301.9100- 3 \\nprovides rules for requesting an extension of time. A request for relief will be \\ngranted the taxpayer if the taxpayer can provide evidence (including required affidavits) that:  \\na. The organization acted reas onably  and in good faith to  make the \\napplication, and \\nb. Granting the relief will not prejudice the government???s interests.  However, \\nsee item 6 below.  \\n(6) An organization will not be granted relief under Treas. Reg. ?? 301.9100- 3 if \\neither:  \\na. Granting relief would result in the organization???s tax -exempt status being \\nautomatically revoked under section 6033(j)(1) effective before the application date (without regard to the provisions of section 6033(j)(3)), or  \\nb. The period of limitations on assessment under section 6501(a) for any taxable year for which the organization claims tax -exempt status has \\nexpired prior to the date of application.  \\n  See Rev. Proc. 2023- 5, 2023- 1 I.R.B. 265 (updated annually).  \\n(7) If an organization does not file a timely application,  or is not granted relief \\nunder Treas. Reg. 301.9100- 3, it will not be exempt prior to the time it filed its \\napplication. See Section 508(a). Nor will it have other privileges of exemption \\nfrom federal income tax such as exemption from federal unemployment taxes  \\n(FUTA) for the prior period. ( . See Rev. Rul. 76 ???262, 1976??? 2 C.B. 310.  Note: \\nThe ruling discusses exemption from federal insurance contributions act \\n(FICA)  taxes . Beginning January 1, 1984,  P. Law 98- 21., provides that all  \\n501(c)(3) organizations are subject to FICA .  \\n(8) An \"incomplete\" application doesn???t  constitute notice under Section 508(a). \\nHowever, an application isn???t incomplete merely because it needs to be \\nperfected. A completed application may need additional information before a \\ndetermination of exempt status may be made. In such cases , the notic e \\nrequirement of Section 508(a) has been met whether or not the additional information is timely received. However, absence of the following information \\nwill cause an application (other than Form 1023- EZ application)  to be \\nincomplete:  \\na. Copy of the articles of organization \\nb. Copy of the bylaws or internal rules of operation -45-   c. Balance sheet for most recently completed tax year  (or the most current \\ninformation available if a full tax year has not been completed.)  \\nd. Statement of receipts and expenditures  (if in existence  less than one year \\n??? provide projections for current year and next two years , if in existence \\nmore than one year but less than five, provide actual income and \\nexpenses for past years and good faith estimates for future years for a \\ntotal of four ye ars, if in existence for five years or more, provide actual \\nincome and expenses for the five most recently completed tax years.   \\ne. Any other basic data required by the application or its instructions . See \\nRev. Proc. 2023- 5, 2023- 1 I.R.B. 265, updated annually and Instructions \\nto Form 1023.  \\n(9) An incomplete application will be considered timely filed if the organization \\nsupplies the necessary additional information requested by the Service within \\nthe additional time period provided for in the request.  See Treas. Reg. 1.508???\\n1(a)(2)(ii).  \\n(10) Procedures for the issuance of determination letters on issues under the \\njurisdiction of the Director, Exempt Organizations (EO) Rulings and Agreements , as well as guidance on applicable user fees for requesting \\ndetermination letters  are found in Rev. Proc. 2023 -5, 2023 -1 I.R.B.  265 \\n(updated annually) .  \\nA.2. Application Forms  \\n(1) Form 1023,  Application for Recognition of Exemption Under Section 501(c)(3) \\nof the IRC, to apply for  exempt status under S ection 501(c)(3) . A user fee is \\nneeded to process the application.  \\n(2) Some organizations may be eligible to file Form 1023- EZ, Streamlined \\nApplica tion for Recognition of Exemption Under Section 501(c)(3) of the IRC. \\nTo decide eligibility, the Eligibility Worksheet in the Instructions for Form 1023-\\nEZ must be completed prior to completing Form 1023- EZ. See section VII I. \\nExhibit, A Form 1023- EZ Eligib ility Worksheet : \\n(3) Both Form 1023 and Form 1023- EZ are available on pay.gov.  To file:  \\na. Register for an account on Pay.gov  (enter the term ???Form 1023??? or \"Form \\n1023- EZ\" in the search box).  More information about Form 1023- EZ and \\nits filing can be found on www.irs.gov/charities -non-profits/applying -for-\\ntax-exempt -status.  \\nb. Pay t he required user fee through Pay.gov when the application is filed (by \\ncredit card or bank account).  \\n(4) User fees are l isted in Rev. Proc.  2023- 5, Appendix A (updated annually).  \\nA.3. Application Processing   \\n(1) The IRS tax specialist reviewing an application may request additional information in writing. If all information received establishes that an -46-   organization meets the requir ements for exemption, the IRS will issue a \\ndetermination letter recognizing the organization???s exempt status and \\nproviding its foundation classification. This is an important document that should be kept in the organization???s permanent records.  \\n(2) While an or ganization???s application is waiting for processing by the IRS, the \\norganization may operate as a tax -exempt organization.  \\n(3) Most organizations are required to file an annual information return (Form 990, Form 990- EZ or Form 990- PF) or electronic notice (Form  990-N) while their \\napplication for exemption is pending. An organization???s exempt status can be automatically revoked while its application is pending if it hasn??? t filed a required \\nreturn or notice for three consecutive tax periods after its formation dat e. \\nThese returns are subject to public disclosure.  \\n(4) If an organization has unrelated business income of more than $1,000, it must \\nalso file a Form 990- T, Exempt Organization Business Income Tax Return.  \\n(5) Although donors have no assurance that contributions are tax -deductible for \\nfederal income tax purposes until the application is approved, contributions made while an application is pending would qualify if the application is approved. However, if the application is denied, contributions wouldn??? t qualify. \\nMoreover, the organization would be liable for filing federal income tax returns \\nunless its income is otherwise excluded from federal taxation.  \\n(6) The IRS  will consider a  complete application and will issue a favorable \\ndetermination letter, an adverse letter denying the exempt status requested in the application or, may close the case without deciding if there is no r esponse  \\nto a request for additional information. The IRS  will also close a case without a \\ndetermination if the request  is withdrawn . \\n(7) See Publication 4221- PC, Compliance Guide for 501(c)(3) Public Charities, or \\n4221- PF, Compliance Guide for 501(c)(3) Private Foundations, for more \\ninformation.  \\nA.4. Adverse Determinati ons - Appeal Procedures, Administrative \\nRemedies and Judicial Remedies  \\n(1) A proposed adverse determination letter will be issued to an organization that hasn??? t provided sufficiently detailed information to establish that it qualifies for \\nexemption or if the information provided establishes that it doesn\\'t qualify for exemption. An organization can appeal a proposed adverse determination letter.  \\n(2) Appeals Procedures : \\nAn organization will be advised of its rights to protest the adverse \\ndetermination by requesting Independent Office of Appeals (Appeals) \\nconsideration. The organization must submit a statement of its views fully \\nexplaining its reasoning. The statement must be submitted within 30 days from the date of the proposed adverse determination letter and must  state whether \\nthe organization wants to protest the proposed determination.  For more -47-   information about the role of App eals, see Publication 892, How to Appeal an \\nIRS Decision on Tax -Exempt Status.  \\n(3) After any requested conference and upon consideration of t he organization\\'s \\nappeal (as well as information presented in any conference held) , Appeals will \\ngenerally notify the organization of its decision and issue an appropriate \\ndetermination letter. An adverse decision can be appealed to the courts. If new information is submitted during Appeals ??? consideration, the matter may be \\nreturned to Rulings and Agreements for further consideration.  \\n(4) Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies:  \\nSection 7428 allows organizations to seek judicial relief from an adverse determination from the IRS. Before seeking relief from the Courts, the organization must first exhaust its administrative remedies. Note:  Churches do not have to exhaust administrat ive remedies before appealing an IRS \\ndetermination to the Courts. See Section 7611(g).)  \\n(5) Matters that may be appealed to the Court after administrative remedies are exhaust ed include:  \\na. The initial and continuing qualification of an organization described in in Section 501(c)(3) which is exempt from tax under Section 501(a)  \\nb. Initial and continual classification of foundation status under Section 509(a).  \\nc. Initial and continual classification as a private operating foundation as defined in Section 4942(j)(3). (Note: Other categories of determinations outside the scope of this TG  are covered by the remedies of Section 7428. \\nSee Section 7428 for the full list.)  \\n(6) The following are administrative remedies that should be exhausted before \\nseeking relief from the Court.  \\na. Filing of the correct completed application or group exemption request or \\nfiling of request for a determination of foundation status  \\nb. For a late filed application, requesting relief under Treas. Reg. 301.9100- 3 \\nregarding applications for extensions of time for making an election or application for relief from tax  \\nc. Timely submission of all additional information requested to perfect an \\nexemption application or request for determination of private foundation \\nstatus . \\nd. Exhaustion of all administrative appeals avai lable within the IRS.  \\n(7) The administrative remedies won??? t be considered completed until the IRS has \\nhad a reasonable time to act upon the appeal or protest.  \\n(8) Judicial Remedies:  \\nIf the IRS issues an unfavorable determination letter and all the administrative remedies were exhausted, the organization can seek judicial remedies.  For \\nexample:  -48-   a. If an organization has paid the tax resulting from the adverse \\ndetermination and met all other statutory prerequisites, it can file suit for a \\nrefund in a U.S. District Court  or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.  \\nb. If an organization elected not to pay the tax deficiency resulting from the \\nadverse determination and met all other statutory prerequisites, it can file suit for a redetermination of the tax deficiencies in the U .S. Tax Court.  \\nFor more information, see Publication 556, Examination of Returns, Appeal \\nRights, and Claims for Refund.  \\n(9) In certain situations, organizations  can file suit for a declaratory judgment in \\nthe U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, or the U.S. Tax Court. This remedy is available if an organization \\nreceived an adverse notice of final determination, or if  the IRS failed to make a \\ntimely determination on the initial or continuing qualification or classification as \\nan exempt organization.  \\n(10)  If a suit results in a final determination that an organization is exempt from \\ntax, the IRS will issue a favorable deter mination letter, provided the \\norganization has filed an application for exemption and submitted a statement that the underlying facts and applicable law are the same as in the period considered by the court.  \\n(11)  Additional Resources:  \\na. IRM 7.20.2, Determination  Letter Processing of Exempt Organizations  \\nb. Publication 557, Tax Exempt Status for Your Organization, Chapter 1, Determination Letters and Appeals Procedures . \\nA.5. Effective Date of Tax- Exemption  \\n(1) If an organization timely files its application within the required 27- month \\nperiod (see prior section IV.A.1. Section 508(a) Notice) , the effective date of \\nexemption will be the date the organization was formed. See Section IV.A. 8. \\nEntity Types and Dates of Formation,  following.  \\n(2) If an organization files its application after the required 27-month period, it may \\nbe recognized as exempt only from the date the application was filed. , unless \\nrelief is requested and granted under Treas. Reg. 301.9100- 3. Theref ore, the \\norganization will be a taxable organization for federal income tax purposes \\n(and contributions received would not be deductible) for the period before the date the application was filed.  \\nA.6. Organizations Not Required to Apply  \\n(1) Certain organizations are not required to give Sec tion 508(a) notice by filing a \\nForm 1023 (Treas. Reg. Section 1.508- 1(a)(3)):  \\na. Churches, their integrated auxiliaries, and conventions or associations of churches  -49-   b. Organizations that normally have gross receipts not in excess of $5,000, \\nand are not private f oundations  \\nc. Subordinate organizations (other than private foundations) covered by a group exemption letter  \\nd. A trust described in Section 4947(a)(1) (solely for purposes of sections 507, 508(d)(1), 508(d)(2)(A) and 508(d)(3), 508(e), 509 and chapter 42)  \\ne. Any o ther class of organization that the Commissioner from time to time \\nexcludes from the requirement of filing notice under section 508(a).  \\n(2) Organizations not required  to file notice under S ection 508(a) will be exempt \\nunder  Section 501(c)(3) if it meets the requirements of that section, whether or \\nnot it files such notice. While these organizations aren??? t required to file a Form \\n1023, they may choose to submit one to receive a determination letter \\nrecognizing exemption. A letter of determination is often necess ary for Section \\n501(c)(3) organizations to take advantage of certain benefits ( for example,  \\nstate taxes exemption, applying for grants, discounts,  and so forth ). \\n(3) The regulations provide a formula for what constitutes ??? gross receipts normally \\nnot in excess of $5,000. ??? Treas. Reg. 1.508??? 1(a)(3)(ii).  \\na. Under that  formula, the organization???s gross receipts are deemed to be \\nnormally less than $5,000 if its gross receipts don???t exceed:  \\n1. $7,500 during the first  taxable year  \\n2. $12,000 during the first two  taxable years  \\n3. $15,000 during the first three taxable years . \\nb. The regulations also provide detailed rules for the notice requirement of \\norganizations that start out within the formula but exceed the \"normally not more than $5,000 test\" in a subsequent year.  \\nA.7. Form 8940, Re quest for Miscellaneous Determination  \\n(1) Form 8940, Request for Miscellaneous Determination, is used for the following determination letter requests:  \\na. Advance approval of certain set -asides described in Section 4942(g)(2)  \\nb. Advance approval of voter registration activities described in Section \\n4945(f)     \\nc.

Canadian registered charities listing on Pub. 78 Data and/or public charity \\nclassification  \\n(2) A request described above must be electronically s ubmitted on Form 8940 \\n(except where otherwise permitted, including when such request is made as \\npart of an application for recognition of exemption), along with:  \\na. All information, documentation, and other materials required by Form 8940 \\nand the instructions  \\nb. An electronic  signature signed by an authorized indiv idual under penalties \\nof perjury  \\nc. The appropriate user fee as provided in Appendix A of Rev. Proc. 2023 -5 \\n(updated annually ).  \\nd. For complete information about the filing requirements and the submission \\nprocess refer to Form 8940 and the Instructions to Form 8940.  \\nSee Rev. Proc. 2023- 12 (released in IR 2023- 70) which modifies Rev. Proc. \\n2023- 5 \\n(3) The following information refers to requests of reclassification of foundation status on Form 8940.  \\na. Initial classification of private foundation status All Section 501(c)(3) organizations are classified as private foundations \\nunder Section 509(a) unless they qualify as a public charity. The IRS \\ndetermines an organization\\'s private foundation or public charity status \\nwhen the organization files its Form 1023/1023- EZ. The foundation status \\nwill be included in the organization\\'s determination letter of tax -exempt \\nstatus.  \\nb. Requests to change from one public charity classification to another \\npublic charity classification \\nOn its Form 990, Return of Organization Exempt from  Income Tax Under \\nSection  501(c), 527, or 4947(a)(1) (except private foundations), a public \\ncharity indicates the foundation status  under which it qualifies as a public \\ncharity. Because of changes in its activities or operations, this may differ -51-   from the public charity status listed on its original determination letter. \\nAlthough an organization isn ???t required to obtain a determination letter to \\nqualify for the new public charity status, in order for IRS  records to \\nrecognize any change, an organization must obtain a new determination \\nof foundation status by filing Form 8940, pursuant to Rev. Proc. 2023 -5 \\n(updated annually).  \\nc. Requests from public charities for private foundation status If a public charity no longer qualifies under one of the paragraphs in Section  509(a)(1) -(4), then it becomes a private foundation, and it must file \\nForm 990- PF, Return of Private Foundation,  or IRC 4947(a)(1) Trust \\nTreated as Private Foundation. The organization isn ???t required to, but may, \\nobtain a determination letter on its new private foundation status. The organization indicates this change in foundation status by filing its Form 990-PF return and following any procedures specified in the form, \\ninstructions, or other published guidance. Thereafter, the organization may terminate  its private foundation status by giving notice and qualifying as a \\npublic charity again under Section  509(a)(1) -(3) during a 60- month \\ntermination period. See  Section  507(b)(1)(B) and Treas. Reg. 1.507- 2(b). \\nd. Requests from private foundations for public charity status An organization that erroneously determined it was a private foundation (for example, by incorrectly classifying an item  in its calculation of public \\nsupport) and wishes to correct the error can request a determination letter classifying it as a public charity by showing that it continuously met the public support tests during the relevant periods.  \\ne. Requests for private operating foundation status \\nA private foundation may qualify as an operating foundation under Section \\n4942(j)(3) without a deter mination letter , but the IRS won???t recognize such \\nstatus in its records without a determination letter from the IRS. An organization claiming to be an exempt operating foundation under Section  \\n4940(d)(2) must obtain a determination letter from the IR S reco gnizing \\nsuch status to be exempt from IRC 4940 tax on net investment income.  \\n(4) For complete information about filing requirements and the submission process, refer to Form 8940 and instructions.  \\n(5) See IRM 7.20.3, Processing Foundation Classification and Miscellaneous Requests . \\nA.8. Entity Types and Dates of Formation  \\n(1) Section 501(c)(3) covers only corporations, community chests, funds, and foundations. To qualify, the organization must be organized as a corporation, unincorporated association, or trust. Sole proprietorships, partnerships, individuals, or loosely associated groups of indi viduals won\\'t qualify.  \\n(2) Corporations are the most common form of organization or entity type. A corporation is an entity whose existence is evidenced by a charter or -52-   certificate of incorporation issued by the state under whose laws it was \\nincorporated.  \\na. The date of formation is the date the articles of incorporation are filed with the appropriate State  office . See Rev. Rul. 75??? 290, 1975??? 2 C.B. 215.  \\nb. See Emerson Institute v. United States, 356 F.2d 824 (D.C. Cir. 1966) for a case in which the Service successf ully challenged a claim of de facto \\ncorporate status.   \\n(3) A trust is an entity included in the terms ???fund or foundation??? and is an acceptable form of organization or entity type. See Fifth- Third Union Trust Co. \\nv. Commissioner, 56 F.2d 767 (6\\nth Cir. 1932).  \\na. The date of formation is generally the date the organizing document is \\nsigned (or otherwise adopted) by the relevant parties.  \\nb. A trust created by will isn???t considered organized before the date of the \\nfirst distribution of trust corpus to the trustee, or, if earlier, the date the decedent???s estate is considered terminated for federal tax purposes.  See \\nGCM  38529 \\n(4) Unincorporated associations  require a separate entity be formed from the \\nindividuals who created it. See Trippe v. Commissioner, 9 T.C.M. (CCH) 622 (1950) ; Morey v. Riddell, 205 F Supp. 918 (S.D. Cal. 1962).  \\na. The date of formation is generally the date the organizing document is \\nsigned (or otherwise adopted) by the relevant parties. An association???s constitution or articles of association should be s igned by at least two \\npersons . \\nb. If an unsigned copy is submitted, but there is evidence the original was signed by two or more persons, the copy will be  accept ed if accompanied \\nby a declaration signed by an a uthorized individual. The declaration must \\nattest  the copy submitted is a complete and correct copy of the original \\nand that the original was signed by at least two persons.  See Rev. Proc. \\n68-14, 1968- 1 C.B. 768.  \\nc. If the copy indicates the original wasn???t signed, submission of the declaration won???t cure the defect. In that case, the application should be \\nreturned to the applicant with a request for proof that the organizing \\ndocument has been adopted. Such a document will be acceptable only if \\nthe association can establish that it has operated in a manner clearly \\nshowing ratification by two or more persons.  \\n(5) A Limited Liability Company (LLC) is another entity type that can apply for recognition of exemption under Section 501(c)(3). In addition to completing \\nForm 1023, Notice 2021- 56, 2021- 45 I.R.B. 716, requires an LLC to submit the \\nfollowing information as part of its completed application:  \\na. Submit both the LLC\\'s state- approved articles of organization and its \\nadopted operating agreement. Both the articles of organization and the \\noperating agreement must contain the following:  -53-   b. Provisions requiring that each member of the LLC be either (i) an \\norganization described in Section 501(c)(3) and exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) or ( ii) a governmental unit described in Section \\n170(c)(1) (or wholly owned instrumentality of such a governmental unit).  \\nc. An acceptable contingency plan (such as suspension of its membership rights until a member regains recognition of its Section 501(c)(3) st atus) in \\nthe event that one or more members cease to be Section 501(c)(3) organizations or governmental units (or wholly owned instrumentalities thereof).  \\nd. Express charitable purposes and dissolution provisions in compliance with the organizational test. See lines 1 and 2 of Part III, Form 1023.  for more \\ninformation.  \\ne. The express Chapter 42 compliance provisions described in Section 508(e)(1) if the LLC is a private foundation. See Part VII, line 1a of the instructions for Form 1023 for more information on t hese provisions.  \\nNOTE:  If an LLC formed under a state LLC law that prohibits the addition \\nof provisions to articles of organization other than certain specific provisions required by the state LLC law, the provisions above may be included only in the operating agreement. An  explanation i s required if \\nprohibited from including the provisions in the articles of organization \\nunder state LLC law s. \\n(6) Submit the following representation, signed and dated by an officer, director, \\ntrustee or other governing body member (not an authorized representative):  \\n We represent that all provisions in our articles of organization and \\noperating agreement are consistent with applicable state LLC law \\nand are legally enforceable.   \\n(7) In the interpretation of an organization???s articles of organization or association, \\nState law governs the definition of the respective rights, duties, powers, and immunities of the parties. When an organization contends a term has an unusual meaning (different meaning than generally accepted) under State law, clear legal authority should be presented. See Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(b)(5).  \\n(8) If an organization???s organizing document requires only a non- substantive \\namendment to comply with the organizational test under Section 501(c)(3) (e.g., the addition of a proper dissolution clause) and the organization makes \\nthe amendment (either on its own initiative or when requested by the Service), the organization will be regarded as satisfying the organizational test from its date of formation.

Reorganization  \\n(1) A domestic Section 501(c) organization that changes its form or place of \\norganization can generally avoid having to file a new exemption application if it \\nmeets certain circumstances.  See Rev. Proc.  2018- 15, 2018- 9 I.R.B. 379.  -54-   (2) An organization must report significant changes to its organizational \\ndocuments on any required Form 990/Form 990- EZ/Form 990- PF filing . \\n(3) A private foundation remaining in existence after terminating its private \\nfoundation status under Section 507(b)(1)(A) must file a new exemption application, unless specifically excepted by Section 508(c).  \\nSee Rev. Rul. 74??? 490, 1974??? 2 C.B. 171.  \\nA.10.  Group Exempti on \\n(1) Tax-exemption may be obtained on a group basis for subordinate \\norganizations affiliated with and under the general supervision or control of a central organization. A complete description of the requirements for submitting a group exemption application is provided by Rev . Proc. 80-27, 1980- 1 C.B. \\n677. \\n(2) Notice 2020- 36 contains a proposed revenue procedure that sets forth \\nupdated procedures for group exemption.   \\na. Pending publication of the final revenue procedure in the Internal Revenue \\nBulletin, Rev. Proc. 80- 27 continues to apply.  \\nb. The IRS w on???t accept any requests for group exemption letters beginning \\nJune 17, 2020, until publication of the final revenue procedure or other guidance.  \\n(3) For resources and the current status on group exemptions, visit the Group \\nExemption Resources page on IRS.gov ( https://www.irs.gov/charities -non-\\nprofits/group -exemption- resources ). \\n(4) See IRM 7.20.3.3.11 (07-19-2018 ) or its successor  for additional information \\nregarding the processing of group ruling requests .

Annual Information Returns/Notices  \\n(1) The annual information return/notice required to be filed by an organization \\ngenerally depends on its financial activity .  \\n(2) Effective for tax years beginning after July 1, 2019, the Taxpayer First Act, Pub. L. No. 116- 25 Section 3101 amended Section 60333(n) to require \\norganizations exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) to file their annual  \\nseries Form 990 and Form 990- PF returns electronically . The Act provided \\ncertain transitional relief for small exempt organizations filing Form 990- EZ to \\nrequire electronic filing of this form for tax years ending July 31, 2021,  and \\nlater.  The following table summarizes the forms that an organization should fil e \\nand electronic filing requirements.   \\nStatus  Form to file  Electronic filing \\nrequire ment  \\nGross receipts normally ??? $50,000  \\nNote:   Organizations eligible to file the  \\ne-Postcard may choose to file a full return \\n \\n 990-N \\n (e-Postcard)  Submitted electronically, \\nthere are no paper forms .  \\nAccess through  \\nwww.irs.gov  \\nGross receipts < $200,00 0 and \\n Total assets< $500,000  990-EZ \\n-or- \\n990 Tax years ending July 31, \\n2021, and later  \\n________________  \\nTax years beginning after \\nJuly 1, 2019 \\nGross receipts ???  $200,000, or  \\nTotal assets ??? $500,000  990 Tax years beginning after \\nJuly 1, 2019 (unless \\ncovered by exceptions \\nlisted in form instructions)  \\nPrivate foundation  \\nregardless of financial status  990-PF Tax years beginning after \\nJuly 1, 2019 (unless \\ncovered by exceptions \\nlisted in form instructions)  \\n(3) The information return s and notice are due on the 15th day of the 5th month \\nafter the end of the organization\\'s fiscal year.  \\n(4) The due date may be extended for six months, without showing cause, by filing Form 8868, Application for Automatic Extension of Time to  File an \\nExempt Organization Return, before the due date. An organization will only be allowed an extension of 6 months for a return for a tax year.  \\n(5) The IRS rejects electronically filed returns that are materially incomplete or the \\nwrong return.  -57-   (6) If an organization doesn??? t file a required r eturn or files late, the IRS may \\nassess penalties. Note: There is no penalty assessment for filing Form 990- N \\nlate. See IRM 4.75.22.5.2.1, Penalties to  Be Assessed.  \\nB.2. Automatic Revocation  \\n(1) Organizations that fail to file required Forms 990, 990- PF, 990-EZ or 990- N for \\nthree consecutive years will automatically lose their tax -exempt status. See \\nSection 6033(j)(1)(B).  \\n(2) The IRS is required to notify an organization after the organization has failed \\nto file for two consecutive years. This notice is to meet the legi slative mandate \\nunder Section 3102 of the Taxpayer First Act (Public Law 116- 25). See \\nSection 6033(j)(1)(A).  \\n(3) The IRS issues Notice CP 120C, Second Failure to File an Annual Return or \\nNotice, to organizations as a reminder  to avoid failing to file for the third \\nconsecutive year.   \\n(4) Revocation of the organization\\'s tax -exempt status will occur  on the filing due \\ndate of the third consecutively  missed year.   \\n(5) The IRS issues Notice CP 120A, Revocation Notice for Failure to File an Annual Information Return, to revoked organizations.  \\n(6) Automatically revoked organizations are updated on the Exempt Organizations  \\nBusiness Master File ( EOBMF) to Status 97 on the Integrated Data Retrieval \\nSystem (IDRS).  \\n(7) The IRS publishes and maintains a list of revoked organizations.  The on- line \\nsearch tool, Tax Exempt Organization Search (TEOS), will show revocation information for organizations revoked. See section VI. A. Tax Exempt Organizations Search following.  \\nB.3. Reinstatement After Automatic Revocation  \\n(1) Organizations whose tax -exempt status was automatically revoked because \\nthey didn???t file required Form 990 series returns or notices for three consecutiv e years can apply for reinstatement of their tax -exempt status.  \\n(2) The following four procedures can be used by an organization to apply for reinstatement:  \\na. Streamlined Retroactive Reinstatement  \\nOrganizations that were eligible to file Form 990- EZ or 990- N (e-Postcard) \\nfor the three years that caused their revocation may have their tax -exempt \\nstatus retroactively reinstated to the date of revocation if they:  \\n???

Employment Tax Obligations  \\n(1) All Section 501(c)(3) organizations  that pay wages to employees must \\nwithhold, deposit and pay employment tax, including federal income tax \\nwithholding and Social Security and Medicare (FICA) taxes.  \\n(2) An organization should have a Form W -4, Employee???s Withholding Allowance \\nCertificate, on fi le for each employee.  \\n(3) Employment taxes are reported on Form 941, Employer???s Quarterly Federal Tax Return.  \\n(4) If the IRS has instructed a small employer (one who has withheld employment taxes of $1,000 or less during the year) to file Form 944, Employer???s Annual Federal Tax Return, instead of Form 941, the employer must do so. The employer must file Form 944 even if there is no tax due or if the taxes exceed $1,000 unless the IRS tells it to file Form 941 (or it is filing a final return). The instructions to Form 944 provide information on how to have the filing \\nrequirement changed from Form 944 to Form 941.  \\n(5) Any person who fails to withhold and pay employment tax may be subject to penalties. See IRM 4.23.9, Employment Tax Penalty, Fraud, and Identity Theft \\nProcedures.  \\n(6) Generally , Section 501(c)(3) organizations aren\\'t subject to FUTA tax. \\nHowever, a S ection 501(c)(3) organization is subject to FUTA tax when paying \\nwages to employees on behalf of a N on-Section 501(c)(3) organization.  See \\nSection 3306(c)(8).  \\n(7) Exampl es include:  \\na. A Section 501(c)(3) organization paying wages to employees of a related \\nNon-Section 501(c)(3) organization \\nb. A Section 501(c)(3) organization.  that is a S ection 3504 agent paying \\nwages on behalf of a N on-Section 501(c)(3) organization  \\nc. A Section 5 01(c)(3) organization that is a common paymaster paying \\nwages on behalf of a N on-Section 501(c)(3) organization .  \\n(8) Payments to independent contractors  don???t generally require tax -exempt \\norganizations to withhold or pay employment taxes , but they may have \\ninformation reporting requirements  (Form 1099- Misc) .  \\n(9) If a charity incorrectly classifies an employee as an independent contractor, it may be held liable for employment taxes for that worker.  See IRM 4.23.5, \\nTechnical Guidelines for Employment Tax Issues; and IRM 4.23.6, Classification Settlement Program (CSP).  \\n(10) The requirements for withholding, depositing, reporting and paying employment taxes are explained in Publication 15, (Circular E), Employer???s Tax Guide. For help in determining if workers are employees  or independent \\ncontractors, see Publication 15- A, Employer???s Supplemental Tax Guide. -60-   Publication 557 provides information about tax -exempt status and covers the \\nemployment tax responsibilities of exempt organizations.  \\n(11) Although churches are excepted from filing Form 990, they do have \\nemployment tax responsibilities. Employees of churches or church- controlled \\norganizations are subject to income tax withholding but may be exempt from FICA taxes. Like other 501(c)(3) organizations, churches are not required to pay FUTA tax. In addition, although ministers generally are common -law \\nemployees, they aren??? t treated as employees for employment tax purposes. \\nThese special employment tax rules for members of the clergy and religious workers are explained  in Publication 517, Social Security and Other \\nInformation for Members of the Clergy and Religious Workers. Churches should also consult Publications 15 and 15- A and Publication 1828, Tax Guide \\nfor Churches and Religious Organizations.  \\nB.5.

An application for tax exemption includes the \\napplication form, all documents  and statements the IRS requires the \\norganization to file with the form, any statement or other suppor ting document \\nsubmitted by an organization in support of its application, and any letter or other document issued by the IRS concerning the application.  A reasonable \\nfee for copying and mailing costs may be charged. See Section 6104(d)(1).  \\n(2) IRC 6110 requires the IRS to make redacted versions of its written determinations  publicly available, including : -62-   a. Determination letters  \\nb. Private letter rulings  \\nc. Technical advice memoranda and  \\nd. Chief Counsel advice  \\n(3) Publication 557 provides details of  public inspection requirements for \\nexemption applications, certain material required to be withheld from public \\ninspection, an exempt organization???s obligation to furnish copies to anyone who requests documents, annual information returns and political organization reporting forms .  \\n(4) See IRM 7.28.4., Public Inspection of Written Determinations Under IRC 6110.  \\nV. Examination Techniques  \\n(1) Section  501(c)(3) requires an organization to be both ???organized??? and ???operated??? \\nexclusively for one or more Section  501(c)(3) purposes. If the organizat ion fails \\neither the organizational test or the operational test, it isn???t exempt . See Treas. \\nReg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(a)(1).  \\nA. Primary Objectives of an Examination  \\n(1) The primary objectives for the examination of an exempt organization are to determine if :  \\na. The organization is organized and operated in accordance with its exempt purpose(s), thus continuing to be recognized as exempt from federal income taxes.  \\nb. The Form 990, Form 990- EZ, Form 990- PF, or Form 5227 is complete, \\ncorrect, and contains all public information required by Section  6033.  \\nc. The exempt organization has properly filed all returns and forms for which it???s liable.  \\nd. The exempt organization or its related entities are liable for other taxes and if so, the correct amount of tax.  \\n(2) The core of every exempt organization examination is to examine the following:  \\na. Organizational documents  \\nb. Activities  \\nc. Financial transactions  \\n(3) Section 7602 gives examiners the authority to:  \\na. Examine any books, papers, records or other data necessary to complete an examination.  \\nb. Take testimony under oath to secure additional needed information.  \\nc. Issue summons for information necessary to complete an examination.  -63-   d. Ask about any offense connected to the administering or enforcing of the \\nInternal Revenue laws.  \\n(4) Examination procedures are contained in IRM 4.75, Exempt Organization???s Examination Procedures .  \\n(5) See IRM 4.75.16.1.6 f or a comprehensive list of relevant forms and publications \\nan examiner may need to close an examined or non- examined case,  \\nB. Conducting the  Organizational Test \\n(1) The organizational test applies to the organization???s articles of organization or comparable governing document.  \\n(2) Secure and review all organizational documents (original creating document and all subsequent amendments).  \\n(3) Compare the or ganizational documents and organizational purposes with \\nSection 501(c)(3) provision requirements  to ensure that the organizational    \\ndocuments and the organization???s exempt purposes are consistent with Section \\n501(c)(3).   \\n(4) Confirm  the organizing document:  \\na. Includes an acceptable purpose clause  \\nb. Includes a dissolution clause ( in most cases )  \\nc. Includes a powers clause which is not too broad.   \\nd. See prior section II. Exemption Requirements, B. Organizational Test,  for \\nspecifics.   \\n(5) If an organization fails the organizational test, discuss the issue with your group manager. The manager, agent, and Area Counsel, if necessary, will discuss possible remedies.  \\n(6) See IRM 4.75.11.8.1, Governing Instruments, for guidance on procedures regardi ng an organization???s governing instrument.    \\nC. Conducting the Operational Test  \\n(1) The operational test applies to the organization???s activities and how they  further \\nexempt purposes.  \\n(2) Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3) -1(c)(1) provides that an organization will be regarded \\nas ???operated exclusively??? for one or more exempt purposes if it engages primarily in activities which accomplish one or more of such exempt purposes specified in S ection 501(c)(3). It further provides that an organization will not be \\nso regarded if more t han an insubstantial part of its activities isn??? t in furtherance \\nof an exempt purpose.  \\n(3) There???s no legal definition in the IRC for commonly used terms such as ???exclusively,??? ???primarily,??? ???substantial??? and ???insubstantial??? which are found throughout the IRC and regulations. For purposes of the operational test, these -64-   terms apply to the review of the purposes, activities, time and resources of \\nexempt organizations to determine if they are operating for Section 501(c)(3) purposes. There is no express formula or measurement in the IRC for the operational test. Rather, all  facts and circumstances pertaining to the \\noperational test should be considered when making these determinations.  \\nOften, exemption is determined on the basis of  stated purposes and proposed \\nactivities.  \\n(4) Test and measure the activities and operations to determine if the organization is operating primarily in furtherance of the purpose(s) for which it was granted exempt status.  \\n(5) Examine the sources of income, application of funds, assets and liabilit ies, to \\nthe extent necessary to e nsure that the financial transactions are consistent \\nwith the exempt purpose activities of the organization.  \\n(6) For more information s ee section II. Exemption Requirements, C. Operational \\nTest of this TG.  \\nC.1.

See Section  7803(a)(3).  -65-   C.2. Reviewing and Analyzing  Activities and Financial Records  \\n(1) A Section 501(c)(3)  organization???s operations must be reviewed and analyzed \\nto determine if it???s operating in a manner consistent with its exempt purpose.  \\n(2) The organization???s  purposes, activities and financial transactions are the items  \\nreviewed and analyzed. Consider  the length of time the activity is conducted, \\nthe number and type of employees and volunteers used to conduct each \\nactivity, the assets used to conduct the activity, the liabilities and expenses incurred in conducting each activity, and the revenue generated or not generated by each activity.  \\n(3) Group activities into categories , such as , \\na.

Additional Examination Requirements  \\n(1) During an exam, examiners are responsible for determining if an organization:  \\na. Continues to meet its requirements for exemption and retains its tax -\\nexempt status  \\nb. Filed all required tax and information returns  \\nc. Merits waiving certain filing checks for certain returns  \\nd. Reported information and its tax liability correctly.   \\n(2) All examinations require the conduct of a filing check, which involves:  -66-   a. Reviewing the filing of other returns to determine whether the taxpayer is \\nin compliance with all filing requirements  \\nb. Determin ing whether the taxpayer is liable for other federal taxes, \\npotentially leading to referrals  \\nc. Securing delinquent  returns  \\nd. Expansion of the exam  if warranted . \\n(3) Although by itself not an actual examination, a package audit is a series of additional steps beyond a filing check, generally used in the pre- contact stage \\nof the examination to evaluate completion and accuracy of a filed return. In a package audit process, the examiner reconciles and analyzes inconsistencies between filed returns or between returns and other doc uments available prior to \\nreviewing books and records.  \\n(4) See IRM 4.75.12, Exempt Organizations Examination Procedures, Required Filing checks and Package Audit Procedures , for guidance.  \\nD.1. Required Filing Checks  \\n(1) A filing check , the process to verify the filing of a return,  is always required for:  \\na.

Package Audit Procedures \\n(1) Package audits don\\'t by themselves constitute an examination if the taxpayer???s books and records weren\\'t examined. A package audit:  \\na. Is not a requirement  \\nb. Is performed at the discretion of the examiner  \\nc. Is more time intensive than a filing check and requires a supplemental workpaper  \\nd. Helps to evaluate returns for consistency, completion and accuracy in reporting where needed \\ne. Involves reconciling and analyzing between filed returns, or between filed returns and other documents available prior to the examination  \\nf. Can involve a comparison between any type of return, not just employment tax returns.  \\ng. The conclusion of a package audit is useful in:  \\nh. Identifying additional issues  \\ni. Deciding to expand the scope of the examination  \\nj. Revising examination steps and techniques.  \\n(2) See IRM 4.75.12.5, Package Audit Guidelines  for guidance.  \\nVI. Other Resources \\nA.

Participating Foreign  Financial I nstitution (PFFI)  \\n(including a reporting FI under a M odel 2 \\nIntergovernmental A greement  (IGA ) \\n??? Direct Reporting NFFE  \\n??? Registered Deemed -Compliant FFI (RDCFFI)  that \\nis a Local FFI  \\n??? Registered Deemed -Compliant  FFI that is a Non -\\nReporting Member of a PFFI Group \\n???

FIs  also can use the system to complete a certification of pre- existing \\naccounts and periodic certifications.  \\nRelating to  its FATCA registration, an approved FI , a U.S. financial institution (USFI) acting as a Lead FI, a sponsoring entity, \\nand a direct reporting NFFE  will be issued a global intermediary identification number (GIIN) and will be identified on the \\npublished IRS FFI List . The IRS FFI List is updated monthly to add or remove approved entitie s (or their branches ). For \\nmore information, please visit  the FATCA FFI List landing page\\n. A separate GIIN will be issued to an FI to identify each \\njurisdiction where the FI maintains a branch. A direct reporting NFFE  will receive only one GIIN, irrespective of where it \\nmaintains its  branches.   \\n \\n1.1.1 Addi tional FATCA r esources  \\nIn addition, this user guide includes appendices with additional  resources, including how to get help, a glossary of terms , \\naccount status tables  and XML file preparation instructions for adding multiple sponsor ed entities . \\nFATCA regulations, notices, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) , and other resources are available on IRS.gov???s FATCA \\npage .  \\nUsers can also subscribe to the FATCA newsletter for updates on the latest IRS new s, guidance, regulations and other public \\ninformation related to FATCA.

The table below provides instructions  on these special rules \\nfor registration.  \\nTable 8  ??? Special rules for registration  \\nEntity/Scenario  Instructions  \\nLead  FI and Member FIs of \\nan (EAG)  In general, all FFIs, other than exempt beneficial owners or certified deemed -compliant FFIs that are \\npart of the same (EAG)  must be registered. For purposes of registration, an (EAG)  may have more \\nthan one lead  FI and may organize itself for purposes of r egistration into subgroups under different \\nlead FIs. For example, an (EAG) of 10 FFIs may decide to select two different lead  FIs, lead FI 1 and \\nlead FI 2. L ead FI 1 can carry out FATCA r egistr ation on behalf of four of its m ember FIs and lead \\nFI 2 can car ry out FATCA r egistration on behalf of four of its other m ember FIs. All 10 FFIs within \\nthe same (EAG)  will be registered, even though they are regis tered under two different lead FIs. \\nConsolidated Compliance \\nProgram  If an (EAG)  has in place a consolidated compliance program, as described in Treas. R eg. ??1.1471 -4 \\n(f )(2)(ii), then m ember FIs that elect to participate in the same consolidated complianc e program \\nshould be registered as m ember FIs by the lead  FI that is acting as th e complia nce FI for the \\ncompliance group . \\nReporting FI under a \\nModel 1 IGA  FIs that are treated as r eporting FIs under a Model 1 IGA (see the list of jurisdictions treated as \\nhaving in effect an IGA at FATCA Archive ) should register as  Reporting Financial Institution under \\na Model 1 IGA.  A disregarded entity in a Model 1 IGA jurisdiction must register as an entity \\nseparate from its owne r in order to be treated as a reporting FI under a Model 1 IGA, provided that \\nthe disregarded entity is treated as a separate entity for purposes of its reporting to the applica ble \\nModel 1 jurisdiction . \\nReporting FI under a \\nModel 2 IGA  FIs that are treated as r eporting FIs under a Model 2 IGA (see the list of jurisdictions treated as \\nhaving in effect an IGA at FATCA Archive ) should register as Participating FFI including a \\nReporting Financial Institution under a Model 2 IGA . \\nFFIs and direct reporting \\nNFFE s that are also \\nSponsoring Entities  An FFI or direct repo rting NFFE  that will also act as a sponsoring entity  for one or more sponsored  \\nentities  is required to submit a second registration form to act as a sponsoring entity. The sponsoring \\nentity  will receive a separate GIIN and should only use that GIIN when it  is fulfilling its obligations \\nas a sponsoring entit y. \\nTrustees of Trustee -\\nDocumented Trusts  A trustee of a trustee -documented t rust is generally required to submit a registration form to obtain a \\nGIIN and should only use that GIIN when fulfilling its  obligations as a trustee of a t ruste e-\\ndocumented t rust. In addition, a trustee that is an FFI may need to submit a second registration form \\nfor use in reporting its own accounts . \\nSponsored Entities  A sponsored  FFI and sponsored  direct reporting NFFE  must be registered by its sponsoring entity  \\nthroug h the FATCA Registration website.  Separate GIINs will be issued to each approved \\nsponsored entity  and published on the IRS FFI l ist. Sponsored entities  cannot log into the  online  \\nregistration system and will recei ve their GIINs from their sponsoring entity . \\nUSFIs treated as Lead FIs A USFI registering as the lead FI on behalf of its m ember FIs will register as a lead FI and receive a \\nGIIN . \\nBranch es In general, a branch must be registered as a branch of its owner and not as a separate entity.  \\nHowever, see r eporting FI under a Model 1 IGA, for a special rule for branches that are disregarded \\nentiti es in Model 1 IGA jurisdictions . \\n \\n   \\n                                                                                                                                             \\n15 \\n3 FATCA Online Registration System : User Login  \\n3.1  Launching the FATCA Online Registration System  \\nThe FATCA Online Registration System can be accessed from  the IRS.gov FATCA Registration Landing page . Click the \\n???register or l ogin??? button. Always remembe r to click the ??? logout ??? link when finished with a session or close the browser. \\nClosing a tab when multiple tabs are open, does not immediately end your session until the system closes it due to 15 \\nminutes of inactivity.  \\n \\n3.2  Create a New Account ??? Single, Lead, and Sponsoring Entity  \\nThe first step in the FATCA registration process is to create an online FATCA account. Only a single, lead, or sponsoring \\nentity will be able to create a FATCA account. Member FIs will have their FATCA accounts created by their lead FI and will \\nreceive their  FATCA IDs and temporary access codes from their lead FI, to login as an existing user to complete their online \\nregistration. See Registration Process Overview  for definitions of the different FI types . \\n \\nTo create an account, the user will be required to select and answer  challenge questions and create an access code (password). \\nAfter the single, lead, or sponsoring entity creates its account, it will be issued  a FATCA ID. The FATCA ID is used to \\nidentify the FI or direct r eporting NFFE  only for purposes of registration and is not the same number as the GIIN. A GIIN \\nis issued after the FATCA registration is submitted and approved.  \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 3 ??? Create new FATCA  account for single FI, lead FI, or sponsoring e ntity  \\n \\n1. Select the checkbox that states, ???By checking this box, I declare that I have been authorized by the FI to create a \\nregistration account on their behalf.???

Although the FATCA Registration System navigation \\nbar displays ???Part 3???, Part 3 is no longer a part of the  system .  \\nThe following chapter describes how to answer the questions  within each part of the registration .  \\nFor each registration question , this user guide provides up to two informational sections which help users to answer the \\nquestion. The two sections are : \\n??? Instructions  ??? available for all questions to help the user to answer  the question and navigate the  registration  \\nsystem .  \\n??? Additional Guidance (if applicable) ??? available for questions where additional detail  is necessary to help the user  \\nto answer the question. \\n \\nBe sure to read all text provided before answering the  question. Direct r eporting NFFEs should follow the instructions \\napplicable to FIs, except where other wise indicated . \\n4.1  Registration Part 1  \\nBefore you begin, see Chapter 2.3 I nformation You Need to Register  for the information you need to complete the \\nregistration.  \\nAfter logging into the system, the registration process will begin with Part 1. Part 1 consists of 11 questions that request \\nidentifying information about the FI or direct r eporting NFFE  and must be completed by all FI types. A lead FI can complete \\nPart 1 for its member FI(s), but the member  will typically complete Part 1 for itself. The following section provides step-by-\\nstep guidance for answering the questions in Part 1. See Appendix E  for Registration field format.  \\n1. Access Part 1 of the online registration:  \\n \\n??? First-time login: After you have created an account and the system displays the FATCFIFI-\\nsingle/lead/sponsoring entity account confirmation page (as shown in Chapter 3.1 Launching the FATCA \\nRegistration System), click the ???next??? button. \\n??? Existing users: On your home page (as shown in Ch apter 5 H ome Page and Account Options), under Available \\nAccount Options, select  the registration  edit link available  to you. The link available  is based on your FI type \\nand status.  \\n \\nNOTE : If a user does not log out of the system using the ???logout??? link, the system does not log the user out immediately. \\nThis can occur if the user closes the browser or gets an error message that forces them out of the system. If the user tries to \\nlog back in immediately, a default error message will display  indicating that the FATCA account is locked because it is being \\nedited by another user. The system times out after 15 minutes of inactivity, so after 15 minutes, the original session that was \\nexited will time out and the user will be able to log in again.   \\n                                                                                                                                             \\n23 \\n \\nFigure 14 ???

Registration Part 4 ???  Submit registration (Par t 4) ???  Submission confirmation/next Steps  \\nAdditional Guidance:  \\nFor purposes of Part 4, the term RO means  the individual with authority under local law to submit the information provided \\non behalf of the FI. In the case of FIs or FI branches not governed by a Model 1 IGA, this individual must also have authority \\nunder local law to certify that the FI meets the requirements applicable to the FI status or statuses identified in the registration. \\nThe individual must be able to certify, to the best of his or her  knowledge that the information provided in the FIs or direct \\nreporting NFFE???s registration is accurate and complete.  \\nIn the case of an FI, the individual must be able to certify that the FI meets the requirements applicable to the status(es) \\nidentified i n the FIs  registration.  However, a reporting  FI under a Model 1 IGA that has branches (as identified in Part 1, \\nQuestion 9) that are located outside of a Model 1 IGA jurisdiction will also agree to the terms applicable to the statuses of such \\nbranches.   \\n In the case of direct reporting NFFE , the individual must be able to certify that the direct reporting NFFE  meets the \\nrequirements of a direct  reporting NFFE  under Treas. Reg. ??1.1472- 1(c)(3).  \\n An RO (as defined for purposes of Part 4) can delegate authori zation to complete Part 4 by signing a Form 2848,  Power of \\nAttorney Form and Declaration of Representative , or other similar form or document (including an applicable form or \\ndocument under local law giving the agent the authorization to provide the inform ation required for the FATCA Registration).  \\n \\nBy signing the registration form, the individual certifies that, to the best of his or her knowledge, the information submitted \\nabove is accurate and complete and that the individual is authorized to agree that  the FI or direct reporting NFFE  intends to \\ncompl y with its FATCA obligations.  The RO identified in Part 4 need not be the same individual identified as the RO in \\nQuestion 10 or Question 11B. \\nA reporting FI under a Model 1 or Model 2 IGA ope rating one or m ore branches not in an IGA jurisdiction is also agreeing \\nto the te rms of an FFI Agreement for any such branch. \\n   \\n                                                                                                                                             \\n43 \\n5 Home Page and Account Options  \\nAfter creating an  account, the home page provides a central location for accessing account summary information and \\nmaking changes to the account. The home page includes four sections: Account Information, Available Account Options, \\nMessage Board, and Your Information. Information displayed will vary based on registration status and FI type.  \\n \\nFigure 33 ??? Home page sections  \\n5.1  Account Information  \\nIt will include: responsible o fficer name, point s of contact ( POC) name s, legal name of FI, FI type, FATCA ID, \\nGIIN, a ccou nt status, and effective d ate. \\nThe current registration status will always be displayed on the home page. For more information on the possible Account \\nStatuses, see Appendix C ???  Account Status Tables . \\n1  \\n                                                                                                                                             \\n44 \\nIf the FI is in the process of transferring to an expanded affiliated group, transfer information (tra nsfer pending to, transfer \\nstage, and tr ansfer stage date) will also display.  \\n \\nGlobal Intermediary Identification Number (GIIN):  \\n \\nIf the FI is in approved status, a GIIN w ill be displayed. An FI will use the GIIN to identify itself to withholding agents for \\npurposes of chapter 4 of  the FATCA regulations a nd to identify itself as the reporting institution for information reporting \\npurposes under FATCA. For more information on the composition of the global intermediary identification number , see the \\nFATCA Online Registration System and FFI List GIIN Composition Information page  on IRS.gov.  \\n \\nWhen an Approved FI updates th e count ry/jurisdiction of residence for tax purposes in Registration, the system will update the \\nGIIN when the registration is reprocessed (typically within a few days) and can be viewed on the home page.  The updated \\ncountry/jurisdiction and GIIN will not  displa y on the FFI list until the next publication of the list.  \\nIf you are registered as a single, lead or member type FI and are also a sponsoring entity, each FI type account  has a unique \\nand separate GIIN . \\n \\nEffective Date -  \\n \\nIf the FI is in approved status, an effective date will be displayed. In general, the term ???Effective Date of the FI agreement??? \\nmeans the date on which the IRS issues an initial GIIN to the FI.  \\n \\nIf the FI changes its FI type or transfers to an (EAG) , the effective date remains the same d ate on which the IRS issued the \\ninitial GIIN to the FI.  \\n \\nFor FIs that received a GIIN on or before June 30, 2014, the effective date of the FI agreement is June 30, 2014. \\n \\n5.2  Renewal of FFI Agreement \\nCertain FIs and their branches must periodically renew t heir FFI agreement by verifying and updating their \\ninformation. The IRS will notify all approved FIs via email and message board when a required renewal period begins. The \\nIRS will also send a reminder message prior to the due date.  \\n \\nFIs notified of the potential need to renew their agreement should login to the FATCA Online Registration System and view the ???Renewal of FFI Agreement??? page by selecting the Renew FFI Agreement  link under Available Accou nt Options on \\nthe home page. After viewing the page, FIs  must determine if they need to renew their agreement and then must submit \\ntheir determination. FIs renewing their agreement will maintain the same FATCA ID and GIIN. Lead FIs cannot renew on behalf o f a member FI.  2  \\n                                                                                                                                             \\n45 \\n \\nFigure 34 ??? Renewal of FFI agreement process  \\n \\nThe system???s home page, during the renewal open period, will have a Renew FFI Agreement link for FIs in approved  \\nstatus. All FIs should follow steps 1 through 4 below to determine if they must renew their agreement. FIs required to renew \\nshould complete steps 5 through 7. They should also verify and update responses to all registration answers provided during \\nthe most recent  registration.  \\nFIs required to renew their agreement and fail to r enew , will have their re gistration f lagged as overdue.  I f an FIs  renewal \\nremains overdue, the FI???s registration may be taken out of approved status . In that case, the FI will not appear on the \\npublished IRS FFI List. The IRS FFI List is updated monthly to add or remove approved FIs (or thei r branches) or direct \\nreporting NFFEs. For more information, please visit the FATCA FFI List landing page . \\nNOTE : Please check the FAQ  page for additional information regarding renewal status and general renewal information.  \\nAfter the renewal period ends, the FFI agreement renewal information will remain on the home page, but the link for renewal \\nof agreement will  no longer display. When a new renewal agreement cycle begins, the system will set a new renewal \\neffective date, the renewal link will display , and your renewal status will become due. If an entity m oves out of approved \\naccount status, the FFI agreement renewal information will no longer display.  \\nTable 13 ???

However, t ransferring FIs and receiv ing lead FIs should review \\nthe FFI agreement before the renewal???s due date.  If their respective FFI Agreement renewal becomes overdue, the FIs may \\nbe moved out of approved status causing the transfer to be cancel ed. \\n5.3  Certificatio ns \\nA FATCA certification c onsists of one or more series of questions that the responsible officers of certain entities must \\nanswer and submit to the IRS to confirm the entities??? compliance with the requirements of FATCA.  There are two general \\ntypes of cer tifications:  one that rel ates to an entity???s preexisting accounts (COPA) and another that relates to the entity???s \\ncompliance with various FATCA requirements (periodic certification).  \\nFor more information on FATCA certification requirements, see Treas.

For single, lead , and member FIs, \\nall approved branches if applicable , are included in the FIs certification.  \\nAfter an FIs registration status is approved, the FI will be notified via email an d message board message that COPA is \\navailable for completion. Once the message is received, the FI can complete  and submit the COPA and has until July 1st of \\nthe calendar year following the end of the certification period ( three ful l calendar years after approval) to submit the \\ncertification.  The FI should view the COPA summary information on its home page  which includes the due dates . \\nTable 14 -- COPA Dates  \\nCOPA  \\nFI Effective Date Year  COPA Open Date  COPA Due Date  \\n2014  Effective Date  7/1//2018 * \\n2015  Effective Date  7/1/2019  \\n2016  Effective Date  7/1/2020  \\n2017  Effective Date  7/1/202 1 \\n2018  Effective Date  7/1/202 2 \\n2019  Effective Date  7/1/2023  \\n2020  Effective Date  7/1/2024  \\n*  COPA Due Date extended to December 2018  \\nFIs can submit t heir COPA through the  Certification of Pre -existing Accounts link on the FI home page  and follow the \\ninstructions to complete all required parts.

The initial periodic certification will cover the three full calendar years plus t he time from the effective date of the \\nFFI agreement (or the date the GIIN is issued for entities that do not enter into an FFI agreement (e.g. direct reporting \\nNFFEs) to  the beginning of the first full calendar year ). For example, for an FI that has an agreement with an effective \\ndate of July 1, 2014, the i nitial certification period starts July 1, 2014 and ends on December 31, 2017.  Each subsequent \\ncertification period is the three -calendar  year period following the previous certification period.  The FI has July 1st \\nfollowing the end of the certification period (i.e., six months) to submit the periodic certification .  \\nThe account home page  will display periodic certification information starting on the initial periodi c open date .   \\nThe account  home  page from then  on will always display the most current inf ormation  as long the FI remains in approved \\nstatus .  The periodic certification summary information for the current cycle on the home page includes  the certification \\nperiod, periodic status  (whether the FI has submitted the current certification, certification is due, overdue or not \\nrequired) , due  date, and submitted dat e (for current cycle only) , if applicable .  \\nTable 17 -- Example of Periodic Certification Dates  \\nPeriodic Certification Dates  \\nInitial Periodic Certification  2nd Perio dic Certification  \\nFI \\nEffective \\nDate Year  Initial \\nPeriodic \\nOpen Date  Periodic Due \\nDate  Cert Period \\nStart Date  Cert Period \\nEnd Date  Periodic \\nOpen \\nDate  Periodic \\nDue Date  Cert Period \\nStart Date  Cert Period \\nEnd Date  \\n2014  7/2018 * 7/1//2018 ** Effective Date  12/31/2017  1/2021  7/1/2021  1/1/2018  12/31/2020  \\n2015  1/2019   7/1/2019  Effective Date  12/31/2018  1/2022  7/1/2022  1/1/2019  12/31/2021  \\n2016  1/2020  7/1/2020  Effective Date  12/31/2019  1/2023  7/1/2023  1/1/2020  12/31/2022  \\n2017  1/2021  7/1/2021  Effective Date  12/31/ 2020  1/2024  7/1/2024  1/1/2021  12/31/2023  \\n2018  1/2022  7/1/2022  Effective Date  12/31/2021  1/2025  7/1/2025  1/1/2022  12/31/2024  \\n2019  1/2023  7/1/202 3 Effective Date  12/31/202 2 1/202 6 7/1/202 6 1/1/20 23 12/31/202 5 \\n2020  1/2024  7/1/202 4 Effective Date  12/31/202 3 1/202 7 7/1/202 7 1/1/202 4 12/31/202 6 \\n* Initial Periodic Open Date has been adjusted for 2014 FI Effective Date  \\n**Periodic Due Date extended to December 2018  \\n \\nFIs can submit the certif ication via the  Periodic Certification link on the home page  by following instructions to complete \\nall required  parts .

It is expected that those indicating they are not required to complete a \\nperiodic cer tification for the certification period do so in very specific and limited \\ncircumstances.  \\n \\nWith respect to the periodic certification for Trustee -Documented Trusts, this will be the result \\nif the Trustee of a Trustee- Documented Trust indicates that it did not have any Trustee -\\nDocumented Trusts that are subject to a Model 2 IGA during the certification period.  \\nCompliance  This result will be displayed when a Responsible Officer completes the periodic certification \\nand the responses provided as part of the ce rtification do not indicate any material failure that \\nhas not been corrected prior to the date of the certification; o r a failure by a Registered \\nDeemed -Compliant FFI or Trustee -Documented Trust to comply with any of the requirements \\nwith respect to their FATCA classification.  \\nQualified Certification  This result will be displayed when the RO of a PFFI, Compliance FI, or  Sponsoring Entity \\nindicates that there were events of default during the certification period and/or there were \\nmaterial failures during the certification period that were not corrected prior to the certification \\ndate, but that the FI indicates that it will take corrective actions to remediate the failure.  \\n \\nAn overall result of ???Qualified Certification??? indicates that the FI did fail to co mply with one \\n(or more) of its requirement but that is working on correcting such failure(s).  \\nFailure to Certify  This result will be displayed when a Responsible Officer selects the option indicating that it is \\n???unable to complete a periodic certification  at this time???.  \\n \\nThis will also be the result if the responses provided as part of the certification indicate any \\nmaterial failures or events of default for which the FI indicates that it will not take any \\ncorrective actions to remediate the failure or ev ent of default; or  a failure by a Registered \\nDeemed -Compliant FFI or Trustee -Documented Trust to comply with any of the requirements \\nwith respect to their FATCA classification.   \\nAn overall result of ???Failure to Certify??? will result in an event of default that could cause \\ntermination of the entity???s FATCA status.   \\n \\nSubmitting an additional certification  \\nYou cannot edit a periodic certification once you submit it. Instead, you must submit an additional periodic certification to  \\ninclude updated information. Generally, submitting an additional periodic certification will supersede the previously \\nsubmitted periodic certification. However, all submitted certifications are saved in the registration system. You can view a \\nhistory of submitted periodic certificati ons from the certification history link on the home page.  \\n  \\n                                                                                                                                             \\n59 \\n5.6 Available Account Options  \\nAn FI can access links to manage its account via the Available Account Options section of the home page.

XML File Preparation Instructions for Adding Multiple Sponsored Entities \\nusing a File Upload  \\nThe XML schema file (.XSD) for uploading multiple sponsored entities helps sponsoring entities who are familiar with \\nXML codes to create an XML file containing sponsored entity and sponsored subsidiary branch data that can be uploaded \\nto the FATCA Online Registration system. The targeted users of these  instruction s should have basic working knowledge \\nof XML and prior experience with creating XML files.   For users unfamiliar with XML who still wish to use the electronic \\nfile submission option for inputting sponsored entities, additional information is available at FATCA: Information for \\nAdding Multiple Sponsored Entities Using a Fi le Upload .  \\nThe .XSD file defines all required and optional XML elements and attributes. It can be used to validate an XML file. The validation criteria are based on the special rules and restrictions associated with the required fields for sponsored enti ties \\nand sponsored subsidiary branches in the FATCA Online Registration system. Below are the step -by-step instructions on \\nhow to create the XML file for uploading.  \\nNOTE : For the purpose of this document, sponsored entity generally refers to any of the three sponsored entity \\nclassifications, unless otherwise indicated.   \\n                                                                                                                                             \\n116 \\nInstructions for Creating the Sponsored Entity XML File  \\nDownload and unzip the XML Schema zip file in a compatible XML editor. Two files will appear in the unzipped folder ??? \\nFATCA -FIRegistration -SponsoredEntityUpload- 1.0.xsd (primary schema) and FATCA -FIRegistration -\\nSponsoredEntityUpload- CountryList -1.0.xsd (country/jurisdiction list schema) ??? these should go in the same file directory \\nafter unzipping them. The primary schema file will reference the country/jurisdiction list schema file.  \\n1. Create th e XML header and root element  as shown below, additional detail is provided in the table:  \\n \\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF -8\"?>  \\n<tns:SponsoredEntityList version=\"1.0\" xmlns:tns=\"urn:us:gov:treasury: irs:fatcafiregselistupload\">  \\n \\n \\nTable 33 ???

This element is the root element in an XML \\nfile. It contains fixed version attribute 1.0.  \\n2. Include the FATC A ID of the sponsoring entity. The FATCA ID in the XML should be the same as the FATCA ID of \\nthe sponsoring entity uploading the file. The table below provides additional information for this element.  \\n \\nTable 34 ???

Letters (excluding the letter O), numbers, or \\na combination of both. The FATCA ID must \\nmatch the FATCA account under which the \\nXML  file is uploaded.  \\n3. Create sponsored entity and, if applicable, sponsored subsidiary branch records by including all required elements, \\naccording to the XML schema.  The XML file needs to contain:  \\n??? Sponsored entity record(s) (required)  ??? each record needs th e name, classification, and country/jurisdiction of \\nthe sponsored entity.  \\n??? Sponsored subsidiary branch records (optional) ??? sponsored entities classified as sponsored subsidiaries need \\nthe country/jurisdiction for each sponsored subsidiary branch  \\n \\nThe table  below summarizes the required elements and their descriptions, types, and s pecial rules and restrictions .  \\n \\nTable 35 ???

Validate the file against the XML schema (both pr imary schema and country/jurisdiction list schema files) using any \\nXML editor.  After validation is completed, the XML editor will inform the user of any errors in the XML and the \\nelements that the error is associated with, based on the XML schema???s built -in validation rules. Depending on which \\nXML editor is used for validation, the error messages could be in different formats with varying levels of detail. Follow the error message???s instructions to correct the XML elements and revalidate.   \\n5. Once the XML file passes validation, save the file as .XML.  The file name should:   \\n                                                                                                                                             \\n118 \\n???

The principal purpose of such award is to transfer a thing of value from a Federal agency to a State or local government or other recipient to carry out a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by Federal statute (31 U.S.C. 6304).  A cooperative agreement is an award of financial assistance that is used to enter into the same kind of relationship as a grant.  It is distinguished from a grant in that it provides for substantial involvement between the grant-making Federal agency and \\nthe award recipient in carrying out the activity contemplated by the award (31 U.S.C. 6305).  A grant or cooperative agreement shall be us ed only when the \\nprincipal purpose of a transaction is to accomplish a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by Federal statute.

When implementing this GRS, agencies should \\nconsult the FAQs about GRS 6.1, Email and Other Electronic Messages Managed under a Capstone Approach.  Agencies are reminded that this GRS should not be \\nimplemented in isolation and should be supplemented with agency -wide policies and training.  Agencies must also incorporate this GRS into agency records \\nmanagement implementation tools, such as manuals and file plans. Agencies adopting a Capstone approach should consult other r esources related to email and \\nelectronic message management, specifically  the Capstone approach av ailable on NARA???s email management page .  \\n Agencies must not implement this GRS until obtaining approval of NARA form 1005 (NA-1005), Verification for Implementing GRS 6.1 . Agencies are required to \\nobtain approval of a resubmitted NA -1005 at least  every four years. Additional information, including a link to the form, may be found in the FAQs and in the \\ninstructions accompanying the form.   \\n \\nGRS Sco p\\ne \\n \\nThis GRS provides disposition authority for email records and certain types of electronic messages.  Agencies using this GRS must apply it to email records, but may choose to also apply it to the other allowable types of electronic messages outlined below; this must be documented on the NA -1005.  Agencies wishing to \\nschedule electronic messages outside the scope of this GRS may submit an agency -specific schedule proposing a different scope.  \\n Email  \\n This GRS applies to all email, regardless of how the email messages are managed or what email technology is used. Email, in the context of this GRS, also includes any associated attachments. This GRS may apply to records affiliated with other commonly available functions of email programs such as \\ncalendars/appointments and tasks.  \\n Other Types of Electronic Messages  \\n The GRS does not cover all types of electronic messages.  Agencies may choose to use this GRS for instant messages, text messages, and chat messages that \\nserve a similar purpose as email to facilitate communication and information sharing.  This includes:  \\n \\n??? messages affiliated with email system cha t or messaging functions, and where the messages are managed independently from the email;  \\n??? messages from messaging services provided on mobile devices; and \\n??? messages from messaging services on third-party applications.  \\n \\nExclusions to all items below: \\n128Last updated in Transmittal No. 3 3  General Records Schedule 6.1 \\nJanuary 2023  \\n \\n ??? messages affiliated with social media accounts/social media direct messaging services;  \\n??? messages affiliated with messaging services provided on video conferencing applications and services;  \\n??? voice mail (or similarly recorded) messages;  \\n??? messages affiliated with collaboration platforms; and  \\n??? messages from messaging systems that are ancillary to the purpose of a larger system (for example, a chat function built into  a procurement system). \\n \\nThese records still require NARA-approved disposition authority but are  not covered under this GRS. See the GRS 6.1 FAQ for specific examples of the inclusions \\nand exclusions.   \\nAdditional Scope  \\n \\nEach agency is responsible for determining the scope of implementation when using Capstone, including, 1) whether implementation is  to include only email, or \\nto also include other types of electronic messages; 2) The range of implementation in an organization (agency -wide, specific office, etc.); and 3) the range of \\nimplementation regarding email and/or other types of electronic messa ging technology and system platforms. Brief information on the scope of an agency???s \\nCapstone implementation is also required on the NA -1005.  \\n Agencies are also responsible for defining (and documenting through policy) the official recordkeeping version of email and/or other types of electronic messages to be managed under a Capstone approach, especially when records are captured or retained in multiple locations (e.g., an email archive vs. the live \\nsystem).  Agencies will need to determine the appropriate disposition for other versions of email and other types of records, whether disposable under GRS 5.1, \\nitem 020, or as non -record.   \\n Agencies are expected to apply documented selection criteria to cull the records of Capstone officials (permanent accounts) to the greatest extent possible before transfer to NARA. Culling refers to the removal ??? or otherwise excluding from capture ??? of nonrecord, personal, or transitory messages and attachments. \\nCulling typically includes the removal of spam, message blasts re ceived (such as agency -wide communications), and personal materials (such as emails or \\nmessages to family members not related to agency business). Culling may be manual, automated, or a hybrid of both. Agencies may develop their own policies and procedures  for the culling of temporary accounts.  \\n Applying this GRS  \\n When applying this GRS in part, agencies must ensure that all other records are covered by another NARA -approved disposition authority. Agencies NOT \\nmanaging any of their email or other types of electronic messages under the Capstone approach are still responsible for managing these records by applying NARA -approved records schedules.  \\n  \\nIf an agency is implementing a Capstone disposition approach different from what is provided in this GRS, the agency must submit a records schedule. For example, an agency may want to narrow the list of required positions in item 010, use shorter retention lengths for temporary  records, or extend the time frame \\nfor transfer of permanent records. Agencies who wish to use Capstone for a broader range of electronic messages, specifically those excluded from this GRS, may also submit an agency -specific schedule.  \\n129Last updated in Transmittal No. 3 3  General Records Schedule 6.1 \\nJanuary 2023  \\n \\n  \\nItem  Records Description  Disposition \\nInstruction  Disposition \\nAuthority  \\n010 Email and other electronic messages of Capstone officials.   \\nCapstone Officials are senior officials designated by account or position level.

The rules for determining the source \\nof income are explained in sections 861 through 865 and \\n937, Regulations section 1.937-2, and chapter 2 of Pub. \\n570. Some general rules are: \\n??? The source of wages, salaries, or tips is generally where \\nthe services are performed. If you worked both in and \\noutside the USVI, include on line 1 only wages, salaries, \\nor tips earned while you were in the USVI. However, \\ncertain income earned while temporarily performing  \\nservices in the USVI will not be considered USVI source \\nincome. For details, see De minimis exception, later. \\nActive duty U.S. Armed Forces. If you are a bona fide \\nresident of the USVI and are stationed outside of the \\nUSVI, your military compensation will be sourced in the \\nUSVI under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA).

For details on MSRRA, see Pub. 570. \\n??? The source of interest income is generally where the \\npayer is located.
